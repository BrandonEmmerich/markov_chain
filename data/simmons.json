{"data": [{"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/sorry-youre-working-today-nfl-wild-card-weekend-picks/", "blog_text": "New Yearas Day is my own personal Groundhog Day -- Iam always hungover, Iam always making resolutions that I never end up keeping, and Iam always losing college football wagers that never should have been made because I donat follow college football closely enough. This week, I mixed it up by leaning on the advice of Grantlandas Mallory Rubin, our office guru for the following topics: best and worst cereals, best and worst Popchips flavors, Instagram accounts solely devoted to cat pictures, hardcore nerd-it-up baseball conversations, and all things college football. Hereas how that email chain played out:\nMe: aWho am I betting on in this college playoff?a\nMallory: aI hope you can feel Nick Sabans smoldering glare from across the electronic abyss. BAMA. Always Bama.a\nAnd then:\nMallory: a(Alabama beats Ohio State. Florida State a|A \na|A beats Oregon. Alabama beats Florida State to restore order to the universe. Alabama gives Nick Saban another raise to avoid the indignity of a Big Ten coach making more money than an SEC coach. And then the 49ers hire Lane Kiffin.)a\nI wonat show you the third email in which she raved about FSUas ajuju.a But that ended up being my single worst two-team teaser ever -- itas almost like I single-handedly swung Malloryas college football juju just by asking for her gambling advice. I watched every minute of both games, came away loving the new playoff system even as I hemorrhaged money, and thought Jameis Winston lost that game because HEaS A LIAR AND AN ALCOHOLIC! (Just kidding.A That was my audition for a \n guest-host gig.) Still, this was seven hours well spent because (a) the Bama-OSU game was legitimately terrific, and (b) how many times do you get to scout the top two NFL draft picks going head-to-head in a big game?\nSome disclaimers: Oregonas crazy pace makes it semi-impossible to evaluate Marcus Mariota a|A Winstonas receivers betrayed him with those drops and fumbles a|A Mariota carries himself like the real-life Lance Harbor, a.k.a. the Handsome, Humble, Soft-Spoken QB Who Almost Seems Too Good To Be True a|A Winstonas coach clearly scolded him as things were falling apart and told him to aCalm the f-a-a-a down or youre going to the bencha a|A itas really fun to root against FSU for a variety of reasons a|A itas hard to imagine two cooler QB names than aMarcus Mariotaa and aJameis Winston,a and their unique styles make it so youad WANT them to succeed at the next level.\nOne more disclaimer (something Iave written about many times in this space): I wholeheartedly believe that NFL quarterbacks succeed for the following reasons: atalenta (25-30 percent) and aeverything else,a which covers leadership, charisma, personality, work ethic, intelligence and not doing basically anything that Johnny Football does (70-75 percent). Youare not just the QB in pro football; youare the CEO. Youare setting a week-to-week, day-to-day, hour-to-hour, minute-to-minute example. If your teammates donat believe in you, if they donat follow you, if they donat totally care about protecting you or fighting for you, then youare done. If you canat crouch in a crunch-time huddle -- down four, three minutes left, 80 yards to go -- and look your 10 dudes in the eye and say with complete confidence, aWE ARE SCORING RIGHT NOW,a then youare never making it in (Cris Carter voice) \n.\nNow, you still need to make one specific throw in pro football: that 15-yard frozen rope to either sideline. If you canat make that throw, you donat have a chance. NFL defenses are just too good. And thatas what makes the Winston-Mariota debate so interesting: From what I saw (and what Ive read, too), they both have plenty of athletic ability to make it in the NFL. Mariota fares much better with those leadership/charisma/personality pieces, but its impossible to know yet if he can make every NFL throw. And Winston drew raves for his leadership and charisma ON the field, but his myriad off-field issues (we dont need to rehash them here) undeniably threaten that aforementioned 70-75 percent.\nSo, who seemed more NFL-ish in the Rose Bowl, Winston or Mariota?\nWell, Mariota had a slight lead heading into New Yearas Day and certainly didnat blow it. (Thatas an understatement.) And even if Winstons team fell apart in the second half, with his ghastly Sanchezesque fumble turned touchdown providing the death blow (although his clock management didnt help), Iad rather build around Winston than Geno Smith, Josh McCown, Jake Locker, Blake Bortles or any of these other bottom-of-the-barrel NFL QBR disasters. Both of them just felt NFL-ish to me. At gunpoint, Iad take Mariota over Winston and build a fast-paced offense around him; I just think heas a slightly safer bet. But for a league thatas \n this weekend, the more the merrier. We need QBs. Last nightas Rose Bowl might have lost me money, but at least it made me feel like our collective situation under center is about to improve by 7A percent.\nSpeaking of Lindley, itas time to bang out some Round 1 picks. But first, as always, some actual emails from actual readers.\nBS: And you left out a few other fun subplots: Cowboys fans feeling eerily confident in Tony Romo and Jason Garrett in a playoff game (in all caps: UH-OH); God adding rain and (potentially) ice to Saturday nightas Steelers-Ravens blood feud; Cam Newton doing Cam Newton things; Ryan Lindley doing Ryan Lindley things; Steve Smith doing Steve Smith things; the puncheras chance of the Lions winning in Dallas and inadvertently spawning one of the top-three Detroit football moments of the past 50 years (no, seriously); three tremendous receivers (Antonio Brown, Dez Bryant and T.Y. Hilton) and one formerly tremendous receiver who might still be tremendous but we havenat seen it in a while (Megatron); Andy Dalton either vindicating or enraging everyone who wagered on him in a road playoff game; any and all Jerry Jones luxury-suite shots; Trent Richardson running two yards and falling down somewhere between eight and 10 times; and, one more time, JIM CALDWELLaS FACE ON 26,000 SQUARE FEET OF HIGH-DEFINITION GOODNESS!!!!\nBS: That too! We have a 1-in-5A chance of the Malice at the Dallas!\nBS: And I forgot that one, too. We get to see the aMATTHEW STAFFORDaS ROAD RECORD AGAINST WINNING TEAMS: 0-16a graphic a bunch of times. Can we take the car keys away from every Lions fan right now to be safe? I donat want them driving after this game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBS: Your girlfriend sounds like a keeper! Thatas a funny routine. Belichick as a dad would be just as funnyA a|\naHey, Dad, I lost my tooth!a\n\naOn to the Tooth Fairy a|A a\n\"Hey, Dad, I got into Harvard early admission!a\n\naOn to the first semester a|A a\nCouldnat one of you Weirdos Who Knows How To Do Things On The Internet just create a Belichick soundboard in which he answers any conceivable life-related question with a Belichickian answer? And no, I donat think it is possible for Belichick to live in the here and now. He has a future fetish.\nBS: Proving yet again that Australians are the coolest people on the planet. Iam still waiting for my first moment whenA I say to myself, aI wish Australia werentA there.a Australia is like the Robert Horry or Philip Baker Hall of continents -- it just makes everything it touches a little bit better. Well, except for tennis majors. I still think the Australian Open needs a gimmick thatas better than, aOur court is blue, weare not on grass or clay, and weare not in New York.a I vote for cheering/booing during play in all Australian Open matches. And the tennis community has to look the other way with PED use for those two weeks aA as opposed to the other 50 weeks, when the tennis community still looks away. \n.\nBS: Did you know Peyton Manning has lost more playoff games (12) than any quarterback ever? Did you know heas 1-2 in the Super Bowl, and that he lost those twoA games by a combined 49 points? Did you know Manningas regular-season passer rating (97.5) is 8.3 points higherA than his playoff rating (89.2), even though he played 30 percent of those playoff games on the road? Did you know that Manningas team was favored in 10 of his 12 playoff losses? Did you know he has more one-and-done postseasons (eight) than any other QB ever? Did you know he has only one game-winning drive in the playoffs? Did you know heas lost playoff games to Jay Fiedler, Mark Sanchez and Chad Pennington? Did you know he threw threeA touchdowns and sevenA picks during his one Super Bowlawinning playoff run? Did you know that heas 2-5 in outdoor playoff games on the road, with those twoA wins coming against Trent Green and a washed-up Steve McNair? Did you know that he destroyed the 2013 Pats to the tune of 400 yards, 2 TDs, 0 picks and a 118.4 passer rating and I should immediately shut up?\n\n\nBS: Come on! I finished 101-93-4 against the spread during the 13 weeks when we posted this column, and an astonishing 58-0 during the four weeks when we didnat. And Iam 11-3-2 against the spread in Round 1 games since 2011. GIVE ME THE PROPER AMOUNT OF RESPECT, RANDOM PERSONA FROM KENTUCKY!\nBS: I didnat get the donkey dick cake yet -- did you at least make it gluten-free for me?\nBS: I thought that was hilarious even before I read that someone \n. Is there any way they could fly in 11,000 depressed Atlanta Hawks fans just to complete the NBA TV effect?\nBS: And thatas the real reason why Arizonaas defense aslippeda these past few weeks. You canat thrive on defense knowing that the game is over if you fall behind 10-0. And by the way, when your fans are glumly saying, aIf we only had Drew Stanton for this one,a thereas a 97.8 percent chance that youare absolutely screwed.\nBS: Come on, thatas not fair! The NFLas Ted Cottrell overturned the leagueas original suspension in what ended up being Team Goodellas last flip-flop of the 2014 season. After it happened, I tweeted that aRoger Goodell is like the Elf on the Shelf aA hes an imaginary disciplinary figure who has to be moved around manually from room to room.a Iam calling Goodell that from now on. Heas the NF-Elf on the Shelf. To believe in the competence of his disciplinary acumen at this point, you have to take such a big leap of faith that itas really no different fromA your kids believing that a Christmas elf doll is judging them for bad behavior, reporting back to Santa and switching rooms every night as soon as everyone falls asleep.\nBut donat worry, Roger -- you won. You kept your obscenely overpaid job, you made it to the playoffs, and nobody cares that you just submitted the worst one-year performance in the history of the commissioner position. Not just the NFL, but any sport. Gary Bettman could have climbed on a Zamboni during Thursdayas \n and started running over Blackhawks and Capitals and his 2015 still wouldnat have been worse than Goodellas 2014. Itas amazing that Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Donald Sterling froze Goodell out of the top three for 2014as Anti-Sportsman of the Year. My pick remains Sterling for the same reason that Marty Scorsese won the 2006 Oscar for \n -- itas a career achievement award, basically.\nBS: Sorry, Iam not buying the Ravens. Sing it one last time, Radiohead!\nBS: First of all, settle down. The Ravens arenat the 2014 Wonk Team -- itas almost definitely the 7-8-1 Panthers, a deeply flawed team from a comically incompetent division that went 64 days between victories, then turned things around by beating fourA straight lousy teams and drawing the Arizona Lindleys at home in Round 1. Theyare one win away from securing aABSOLUTELY NOBODY BELIEVES IN US!!!!!a status heading into Round 2as game in Seattle.\n Oh, and if Arizona somehow beats Carolina, then THEY become the Wonk Team. Either way, itas not the Ravens. So rest easy, Jacob from Glendale.\nA quick reminder since weare here: The Wonk Team has won four Super Bowls and a bewildering 22 of 25 playoff games since 2007. The complete list: 2013 Chargers (1-1); 2012 Ravens (4-0), 2011 Giants (4-0), 2010 Packers (4-0), 2009 Jets (2-1), 2008 Cards (3-1), 2007 Giants (4-0). Again a|A 22 of 25!!!!! Including some of the biggest underdog playoff upsets this century. Beware of the Wonk Team. Repeat: Beware of the Wonk Team.\nBS: aWhat if I told you that Johnny Football would become Johnny TMZ, Johnny Clipboard, Johnny Curfew and Johnny Waiver Wire in the span of nine months? From ESPN Films, itas a new 30 for 30 documentary, \n, directed by Skip Bayless.a\n\n\nBS: You totally insulted our 2014 co-LVPs, Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. Come on.\n\n\nBS: Allow me to counter those numbers with \n, covered on ESPN.com and \n. Basically, Dallasas recent doppelgA$?ngers as a great offense/lousy defense team were the 2010 Saints (lost Round 1 to Seattle), the 2011 Packers (lost Round 2 to the Giants) and 2008 Saints (missed playoffs). So I think thatas a dead heat.\nBS: Thatas the winner on paper, but \n: Three straight wins (two on the road), six TDs, one pick and a QB rating in triple figures. You canat judge 2003 Delhomme by the Delhommes that came later. Anyway, I didnat have time to peruse decades and decades of playoff football, but I did pore over the 21stA century and found these honorable-mention worst matchups: \n(January 2012),A \n (January 2006), \n (January 2002), and \n (December 31, 2000).\nYour winner? Chris Simms vs. Washed-Up Mark Brunell! That Bizarro Shootout yielded 27 combined points (seven from a fumble TD return), 239 total passing yards and just 363 total yards of offense as Washington (2.5-point favs) covered in Tampa Bay. Brunell and Simms started only three more NFL games \n. And yes, I will always have a fond memory of this game because I picked it correctly \n. Donat bring atrocious QB matchups into my house!\nBS: I actually didnat believe this \n. Itas true. You know what else is true? Ryan Tannehill now has as many 4,000-yard seasons as John Elway and Joe Montana \n. Letas just move on before I start sobbing.\nBS: As for the other side a|\n\n\nBS: All good points. Then again, the chasm between Watt and Every Other Good Defensive Lineman was significantly larger than the chasm between Rodgers and Every Other Good QB. And Watt owned the 2014 season more than anyone else. But I thought Rodgers needed a signature game to swing the race a|A and thatas exactly what happened. He swung the race just enough by coming back from injury to beat the Lions. Packers fans believe itas their version of the Willis Reed game; non-cynical NFL fans believe it was one of the most dramatic moments of the season; and cynical NFL fans have Rodgersas amiraculousa return ranked somewhere between Paul Pierceas Wheelchair Game in the 2008 Finals and Keyser SAPzeas final scene in \n. But Rodgers needed SOMETHING like that to pass Watt. And it happened.\nBS: An undeniably compelling case. It forced me to subtly revamp my Top Six Rivalries list:\n1. Ravens-Steelers\n\n2. Brady-Manning\n\n3. Goodell-Truth\n\n4. Cowboys-Eagles\n\n5. Andy ReidaThe Clock\n\n6. Aaron RodgersaDaniel Day-Lewis\n\n7. Mike SmithaFourth Down\n\n\nBS: Probably not a good sign for Baltimoreas Round 1 hopes that this email cracked my aTopA ThreeA Reasons Baltimore Could Come Back To Haunt My Pittsburgh Picka list.\n\n\nBS: This was the funniest Sal-related email coming off the Cousinas improbable hot streak on \n (15-0-3 in the last six weeks), narrowly edging the reader who sincerely wondered if Sal was inadvertently proving Malcolm Gladwellas 10,000 Hours theory from \n. (In other words, Salas 10,000 hours of watching football finally paid off.) By the way, Sal gives his Round 1 picks on Friday nightas \n at 11 ET. If he nails Round 1, Iam going to fully expect him to push it to the limit and buy a Tiger.\nBS: Coincidentally, thatas also what Iam expecting from Ryan Lindley in Round 1 -- a daddy-sized poop.\n\n\nBS: Yes, Nick sent me this email before Ohio Stateas upset over Alabama. But anyone who can successfully compare an iconic 26-year-old wrestling moment to a current (and important) NFL story line automatically makes the mailbag, especially if it allows me to embed a YouTube clip of said wrestling match. Itas just one of my rules. Give it up for the Honky Tonk Man, Urban Meyer!\nBS: That Niners debacle incorporated three of my favorite sports rules!\n Anytime a seemingly significant sports development inspires one of my readers to successfully compare it to one of Honky Tonk Manas most famous matches, then you can officially assume that something significant happened. (Covered above.)\n If your team is being run by someone who inherited that chance, didnat earn his own fortune and wants to prove to everyone that he can successfully run stuff, too, then thereas an 80 percent chance your team is headed for major trouble. (Cut to Knicks fans and Lakers fans nodding sadly as Yankees fans self-consciously glance at each other wondering if they should be nodding sadly or not.)\n If your biggest rival is unequivocally delighted that you just made a particular move, then you just f-a-a-aed up. Period. End of story. You know who loved the fact that Harbaugh left San Francisco? Seahawks fans! Oh, and Pete Carroll! \n: aYeah, itas good heas out of here. He was tough. We wish him the very best. He had a fantastic run in this division. a|A Iam sure theyall make a great replacement and all that kind of stuff, but he was tough to go against.\"\nTranslation: \nWhy is this called the Parcells Principle? After a preciously young Patriots team came within one stupid kickoff of upsetting Green Bay in Super Bowl XXXI,\n the disintegrating Bill ParcellsaRobert Kraft relationship officially fell apart and Parcells jumped to the Jets (and took Bill Belichick with him). If you rooted for any another AFC contender, this brought you an impossible amount of delight. You LOVED that Kraft pushed Parcells out. What happened? Kraft hired Carroll to coach an absolutely loaded Patriots team that lost a frustrating 7-6 playoff game in Pittsburgh.\n The Pats didnat win another playoff game until the Belichick-Brady era kicked off in 2001. Speaking of the PatsA a|\n\n\nBS: My illegitimate son Barnwell already \n, including the crucial point that avoiding Bradyas $24 million escrow payment helped only New Englandas cash flow (not its cap). So I will only add these three points \n:\n Peyton Manning \n, then eventually \n to guarantee him $58 million over his first three Denver seasons. \n was more team-friendly; he made $33 million guaranteed for 2013 and 2014 combined, then had another $24 million guaranteed coming that was going to coverA the next three seasons (2015 through 2017) and turned him into the Tim Duncan/Dirk Nowitzki of Football. (Translation: an unbelievable bargain for a contender.) Thatas why my sh-a-a detector went off. Why not lock down that bargain? For more short-term acash flowa? For someone whoas a billionaire? Something didnat add up.\n OK, so dig a little deeper. The revised adeala pays Brady $27 million total over the next threeA seasons (a $3 million bump), but itas guaranteed only if Brady gets injured during THIS postseason. As the Patriots furiously leaked their athis isnat a big deal, this is just Brady being an awesome teammate who just wants to wina story to the appropriate parties, buried within those reports was the following tidbit: Itas now a million times easier for the Patriots to release Brady thisA spring. Again, \n Back to Brady, who eschewed $24 million guaranteed for $27 million with no guarantees. Yet another example of New Englandas unabashed exploitation of Bradyas generosity and team-first nature \n? But buried in all this weekas news stories \n, aBrady also now can be released by the Patriots without any liability, but he then would become an unrestricted free agent, free to command the type of guaranteed money he has agreed to surrender.a\nWhy would Brady do that? Thatas simple: because he loves playing football, he doesnat have to worry about money,\n and he wants to end his career on HIS terms. Remember, Brady has the best chance of any quarterback ever of succeeding in his early-forties; I wrote about his whole eats-drinks-sleeps football machine routine two months ago, then \n \n. Nobody takes better care of his body. Even if he was better six or sevenA years ago (especially with deep balls), heas still one of the best five QBs in football.\nWhat kind of \n is that worth? What are three years of Tom Brady worth on the open market thisA spring for Houston, Buffalo, the Jets, the Rams or whomever? If youare an up-and-coming team like the Rams, wouldnat you give Brady $55 million guaranteed for three years without even blinking? If youare the Texans, and youave been crippled by the QB position for just about this entire century, wouldnat you fork over that $55 million in 2.3 seconds? Oh, here are the 2015 free agents at that position right now:\naC/ Brian Hoyer\n\naC/ Mark Sanchez\n\naC/ Jake Locker\n\naC/ Ryan Mallett\n\naC/ Michael Vick\nAnd here are the trade candidates ...\naC/ Jay Cutler\n\naC/ Robert Griffin III\nDamn. I might have gone low with that $55 million guess. And again, Brady wonat care about signing for the most money possible. For all we know, head pick a franchise based on the available talent, the coach, the owner and the situation, in that order, with money being the last (and least important) variable.\nSo hereas where you say, aWell, why wouldnat he just stay in New England then?a\nGreat question. I spent the whole week thinking about it. The answer: \n During Bradyas entire career, the Krafts and Belichick have successfully pulled off their good cop/bad cop routine; the Krafts make the players feel like part of their extended family a|A right up until Win-At-All-Costs Belichick does whatever is best for the team. Itas a mutually beneficial relationship in every respectA aA not just because of the three Super Bowls, but because the Patriots are 150-42 (not including playoffs) since 2003.\n Bill Belichick has to be mentioned first, second, third, fourth or fifth in any aWhoas the greatest person to ever run an NFL team?a conversation. Itas just a fact.\nOf course, over the past 13 years, Brady watched Belichick shank Drew Bledsoe, Ty Law, Lawyer Milloy, Troy Brown, Richard Seymour, Wes Welker, Willie McGinest, Logan Mankins and other esteemed Patriots over the years. Thatas why everyone respects the Belichick-era Patriots so much, whether itas real respect or begrudging respect. The plan never wavers. Belichick will always do whatas best for the future, whether itas trading down in drafts for extra picks or dumping beloved veterans one year too early instead of one year too late. And Brady knows it. He also knows how miserable Belichick can be day-to-day, especially if youare letting him down in some way.\nSo, assuming the Patriots didnat a|\nA. Renege on that escrow payment, then put Brady in the position of swallowing his anger for five weeks because he didnat want to affect the teamas Super Bowl chances (doubtful, but it canat be ruled out)\nB. Already make a wink-wink deal for the future that they canat announce yet (even more doubtful)\na|A then this contract atweaka was about flexibility over everything else. Even if neither side will admit it. I believe the Patriots wanted more flexibility to gently push Brady out if (REPEAT: IF) his performance slips or his body breaks down (think Favre in Green Bay or Manning in Indy). And I believe Brady wanted the flexibility to find a different team if his relationship with Belichick soured for whatever reason. Removing those guarantees, and turning that contract into a year-to-year thing, provided him that flexibility.\nAnd if you think this isnat a big deal, hereas why you are wrong. A week ago, Tom Brady was locked down in New England through 2017. Now, its much easier for him to leave in three months aA a decision that might be affected, one way or the other, by whatever happens these next fiveA weeks. Something HAS changed here.\nLast point: Like so many others these past few days, I found myself getting sucked into HBO Signatures restored/HD/widescreen five-day marathon of my second-favorite TV show ever, \n In the last episode, Cheese and a few other drug dealers are figuring out how to buy out Marlo when someone makes a aback in the daya case and Cheese angrily interrupts him.\naThere ainat no back in the day, n-a-a-a-a,a Cheese hisses. aAinat no nostalgia to this shit here. Thereas just the street and the game and what happen here \n.a\nIsnat that how Bill Belichick runs the Patriots? \n Itas all about what happen here \n Belichick shanking Brady 13 years after he shanked Bledsoe FOR Brady would be the ultimate Belichickian moment. The man doesnat pay for past performance. He cares only about what youare worth right now. Thatas the biggest reason why the Patriots win 12 games and compete for the Lombardi every year. And thatas the biggest reason why itas conceivable -- repeat: conceivable -- that this contract atweaka is a bigger deal than everyone thinks.\nAnd yes, Iam skipping over the fact that Cheese got shot in the head right after he finished that mini-speech (and all the parallels that can be drawn there). Letas get to the Round 1 picks ...\n You laid nearly a touchdown with a lame division champ that went 64 days between wins. You backed a 7-8-1 team with the 25thA DVOA over an 11-5 team with the 22nd overallA DVOA. You got too carried away with an end-of-the-season winning streak over four teams that finished a combined 22-42. You ignored an old-school Playoff Manifesto Rule: aWhen In Doubt, Check the Coaching Match-upsa (Rivera vs. President-Elect Arians). You didnat see \n about how three of the other four aWorst QBs To Start A Playoff Game Since 1972a won those games.\n You spent too much time worrying about Arizona scoring and not enough time wondering what would happen in a 13-10 game if Cam made one dumb mistake. Worst of all, you backed the wrong Wonk Team -- you thought it was Carolina when it was really Arizona all along.\n You grabbed the Cards even though they limped to the finish line and turned into an advanced-metrics disaster. You talked yourself into a road underdog that scored 87A points total in the last SEVEN games. You went against a suddenly hot QB who loves to freelance in chaos playing a risky defense that loves to create chaos but struggles against running QBs. You didnat care that someone named Kerwynn Williams was starting at running back, or that the Cards finished .500 on the road only because they beat Brandon Weeden, Derek Carr, Shaun Hill and Eli Manning Without Odell Beckham Jr. You got scared by the high-ish line without asking yourself, aWhat happens if Arizona falls behind by 10 points and has to start making things happen?a Oh, and you backed Ryan Lindley and his 51.3 passer rating on the road. You backed Ryan Lindley on the road!\nREPEAT: YOU BACKED RYAN LINDLEY ON THE ROAD!\nIN THE FREAKING PLAYOFFS!\nWHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?????\nHAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND????\nTHIS IS RULE F-ING NUMBER ONE OF THE PLAYOFFS: DONaT TRUST PEOPLE LIKE RYAN LINDLEY IN A ROAD PLAYOFF GAME!!!!!\n: You forgot that John Harbaugh is 9-4 in the playoffs (seven wins away from home). You didnat check the weather -- rain and possible ice leads to uglier games (Baltimoreas specialty) and makes special teams more important (advantage: Baltimore). You forgot about that electric Jacoby Jones return thatas definitely going for a TD or coming damned close. You stupidly thought LeVeon Bellas absence because of a hyperextended knee wouldnat make that much of a difference. You forgot that Haloti Ngata was coming back from getting grounded for taking Adderall the night before the SATs. You forgot that \n throws a better deep ball than anyone, and Pittsburgh is more prone to give upA deep balls than anyone. You forgot that Pittsburgh lost to Tampa, Cleveland and the Jets. You forgot that Todd Haley was involved. Most of all, you forgot the Ravens love throwing you off their scent in the playoffs, then sucker-punching you right in the gonads. Thatas what they do.\n You ignored the probability of Baltimoreas putrid secondary getting overpowered by the NFLas most dangerous passing attack. You mistakenly thought the weather might cripple Pittsburghas offense. You forgot that the Lewis era officially died in Baltimore when Ed Reed left. You forgot that Baltimoreas offensive line was all kinds of banged up, and that Pittsburgh rushes the passer pretty well. You forgot how scary it was to wager against Big Ben in Big Games unless heas going against Tim Tebow during the final 15 minutes of \n You forgot that the Ravens went 4-0 against the NFC South (congratulations!) and or that they beat one above-.500 team all season (in Week 2, no less). You forgot about Pittsburghas many playmakers, and you definitely forgot about the great Antonio Brown. You forgot that Pittsburghas destiny might be taking out Manning on the road as heavy underdogs again, just like it did \n. Most of all, you forgot about karma. Was there a better karmic ending to this 2014 Ravens season then aDestroyed by their most hated rival in Round 1?a Of course not.\n You forgot how scary Andrew the Giant was, especially when heas not getting threatened by a decent enough pass rush.\n \n, that Jermaine Gresham was limping around, and that MohamedA aIam That Guy You Always Checked Out On Your Waiver Wire For Five Minutes But Never Actually Picked Upa Sanu was Cincyas second-scariest receiver. You forgot that Indy waxed Cincy in Week 7: 27-0. You forgot that Vontae Davis could handle A.J. Green if Green miraculously played at the last minute. You forgot about the Adam VinatieriaMike Nugent mismatch. Do you realize you took Marvin Lewis in a playoff game? Or that you took Andy Dalton? Or that you took Andy Dalton in a road playoff game? Or that you took Andy Dalton in a road playoff game in a dome? Or that you took the Bengals in the playoffs, period? Why havenat you disabled your online gambling account already?\n You forgot that the Colts were 2014as Good Bad Team; they got destroyed three times in the last nine weeks. You forgot that Ahmad Bradshawas injury created the NFLas most pathetic running back crew. You forgot that New England and Dallas ran the ball down Indyas throat a|A and Jeremy Hill could do it, too. You forgot about the 3.3 percent chance that Jim Irsay would wander onto the field like Shooter in \n. You forgot that Gio Bernard turned into a frightening third-down back. \nA You forgot that Luck throws it up for grabs too much, and that Cincyas excellent secondary loves picking off dumb passes. You forgot that Indyas home-field aadvantagea just hadnat been overpowering, and that four favorites never cover in Round 1. You forgot that Cincyas overall roster was just better than Indyas roster. You forgot that Matt Ryan, Peyton Manning and Randall Cunningham also lost THEIR first three playoff games. You forgot that Dalton could destroy Cincyas postseason without necessarily doing it this weekend.\n Tony Romo. Jason Garrett. Tony Romo AND Jason Garrett. You ignored how Dallasas biggest strength (running the ball) conflicted with Detroitas biggest strength (stopping the run). You laid a touchdown with a crummy defense against a playoff team with multiple big-play weapons. You forgot about Megatron. You forgot it was Golden Tateas destiny to have a Revenge Game in Seattle in Round 2. You forgot that you were backing Jerry Jones in the playoffs, that Dallas crowds sucked this season, that a worn-down DeMarco Murray had carried the ball 392 times already. You forgot how sad Troy Aikman sounds when heas announcing a big Cowboys loss. You teased the Panthers and Cowboys and stupidly forgot to hedge with Lions +7. You got a little too excited about Round 2: Romo vs. Rodgers in the Ice Bowl 2.0. You forgot about Staffordas Back Door cover potential. And you forgot that (a) Suhas appeal getting reversed, (b) Suh shutting down Dallasas run game as part of Detroitas upset victory in Round 1, then (c) Suh signing with the New York Giants in March would be a classic under-25 Cowboys fan trifecta.\n You took Jim Caldwell and Matt Stafford, together, in a nationally televised playoff game. You forgot that Stafford is Jay Cutler with better PR. You didnat realize that Detroitas defense looked terrific as long as it wasnat playing an elite offense. You forgot that Eric Ebron was destined to drop two big third-down catches, Matt PraterA was destined to miss one semi-easy field goal, and Caldwell was destined to screw up two challenges and one end-of-the-half clock management situation. You forgot the Lions were 0-3 against winning teams since Week 2. You forgot that sloppy teams with composure/coaching issues canat win playoff games on the road. You forgot how good Romo, Murray and Dez were all season. You forgot that a great offensive line always beats a very good front four. You forgot Staffordas big-game bad luck could easily trump Romoas big-game bad luck. Most of all, you forgot the 2014 Cowboys repeatedly proved that they could extend leads and put games away. You were afraid of that semi-high line a| and you shouldnat have been."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-tale-of-two-flaccos/", "blog_text": "Anytime you type \"Flacco\" into your iPhone, it autocorrects to \"Flaccid.\" Does it happen courtesy of a ball-busting Apple programmer from Pittsburgh or Cleveland? Maybe. Or maybe its just the perfect way to describe Baltimores quarterback. Maybe hes really two people -- Joe Flaccid is Regular-Season Clark Kent, Joe Flacco is Playoff Superman.\nYou barely notice Joe Flaccid during the regular season ... unless hes starting for your fantasy team, in which case something clearly went wrong. That version of Flacco averages 21.1 touchdown passes per season. He has never thrown for 400 yards (in a game) or 4,000 (in a season). He started 112 games and topped 300 yards in only 21 of them. Hes never run for 200 yards in a season. He has one career four-TD game and one career five-TD game. He spent most of 2013 looking like this generations Vince Ferragamo: 19 touchdowns and 22 picks (and just a 73.1 passer rating). Until 2014, he never cracked the top 10 for QBR.\n He cracked the top 10 for passer rating only once: in 2010, when he finished seventh. His career passing rating (84.8) trails generational rivals like Jay Cutler (85.2), Andy Dalton (85.2) and Cam Newton (85.4).\nHis best quality? Hold on, you might want to take a seat because its so exciting: thats right, durability.\nIn his first seven regular seasons, Joe Flaccid won 72 of his 112 starts without missing a game. He also throws a splendid deep ball that yields big plays and valuable pass-interference penalties. In fact, Flacco led the NFL in a goofy-but-valuable \n called \"clutch-weighted expected points based on penalties\" in five of the last six seasons. Its a fancy way of saying, \"He excels at throwing deep and making SOMETHING happen.\" Over everything else, its the scariest thing about wagering against Joe Flaccid -- an experience that isnt really that scary.\nTo recap: durability, pretty deep balls AND timely pass-interference penalties! You wouldnt call it the sexiest quarterback package, and you certainly wouldnt feel great about paying one of the leagues most lucrative ransoms for it. Did Joe Flaccids mega-contract make Bill Barnwells list of \n just five months ago?\n Yes. Yes it did.\nThen again, the Ravens werent paying for Joe Flaccid. They were paying for Joe Flacco. You know, the calm dude from the playoffs. The towering, smiling, handsome, lanky, confident, gunslinging, teaser-killing, flag-generating, deep-ball-flinging machine. This version of Flacco suffered growing pains: seven straight road playoff battles; in the first five, he had no 200-yard games, one touchdown and six picks, three wins and two losses, and two season-ending stink bombs against the 2008-09 Steelers (\n) and 2009-10 Colts (two picks, three points total). He looked better in his third postseason appearance (two more road games, including \n), then blossomed the following winter when deep threat Torrey Smith showed up. Flaccos seven-game playoff stretch from January 2012 through last weekend kinda sorta maybe backs up John Harbaughs claim that Flacco is \"the best quarterback in football.\"\nWhat did those five words REALLY mean? \nI mean ... you definitely cant call Harbaugh a liar.\n Check out these highlights:\n* Baltimore won six of seven playoff games. The loss? 2012s AFC title game ... when Lee Evans briefly caught a game-winning touchdown that New Englands Sterling Moore heroically stripped away, then Billy Cundiff missed the game-tying 32-yarder.\n* 2013s four-victory hot streak that yielded a Super Bowl MVP trophy, road wins over two legends (Brady and Manning), one of the greatest throws in football history (the pseudo-Hail Mary to Jacoby Jones), a game-winning drive IN THE SUPER BOWL, and a ridiculous 11-0 TD/INT ratio.\n* The following 13 words will almost certainly go on his NFL tombstone: \n* His stealth legacy as the guy who unleashed the best contract run in NFL history (and maybe even sports history). In the winter of 2013, Flacco \n his value on the open market. It was like Ronnie and Sammi during the final \n season, only the exact opposite. (More on this in a second.)\n* With the \n, has any quarterback ever slapped together a better seven-game playoff stretch? Flaccos numbers: 1,881 passing yards, 17 TDs, one turnover, a 110.7 passing rating (including five straight 105-plus games), 74.3 QBR, and 28 times when my wife walked into the TV room and asked, \"Whos that? Hes really handsome.\"\n* You want to wager against Joe Flacco? He has covered the last six Baltimore playoff spreads. Not since Eddie DeBartolos heyday have Vegas casinos feared the powers of an NFL Italian this much.\n He also became our second-most important/influential/beloved Delaware-related celebrity, narrowly edging juggernauts like Joe Biden, Elisabeth Shue, Ryan Phillippe, Paul Goldschmidt, Aubrey Plaza and the great Valerie Bertinelli. With a second Super Bowl ring, he might even pass Elena Della Donne and become Delawares most beloved celebrity, period.\n* In \n, Flacco submitted a Hall of Fame quote about playing quarterback in pressure games. He was remembering how Elvis Dumervil tried to chat with him during the Steelers game, but Flacco blew him off because he was, as Dumervil put it, \"in the zone.\" Heres how Flacco described the zone.\n\"I gotta be able to react to things and think, and not let my emotions get the best of me. My personality fits that. I get the most comfort before a game just sitting in here and saying to myself, Go out there and just play the game. Take what they give you. Keep doing it, keep doing it, keep doing it. If you do it well enough, youre going to win a football game. Having that peace definitely helps. You have to be in the moment and stay in the moment.\"\nHe could have been describing Aaron Rodgers (read the Joe Cool section in \n), Phil Mickelson, Madison Bumgarner, Tim Duncan ... I mean, pick a name. The Tao of Joe Flacco makes sense. \n For whatever reason, he cant remain in that zone from September through December -- thats why Joe Flaccid made Barnwells Worst Contracts list as the NFLs version of Deron Williams. But in the playoffs? Joe Flacco finds that zone. He finds that peace.\n\nFor most of the history of modern sports -- say, 1950 through 2005 -- we would have raved that Joe Flacco was \"clutch\" and left it at that. Ten years later, its much riskier to spit out a blanket statement without offering additional evidence ... unless you want to be branded with a \"HOT TAKE ALERT!\" tattoo and get skewered across the Internet. You cant cut corners in 2015. Were too sophisticated about sports, mainly because of a relatively recent infatuation with advanced numbers and unconventional metrics. For instance, Kirk Goldsberrys recent story about \n was one of Grantlands smartest pieces ever; Goldsberrys angle would have been inconceivable in 2005 (both visually and intellectually), back when we would have collectively decided, \"James Harden is an MVP candidate, hes playing great!\" without peeling off more layers of the Harden onion. I love numbers. They make me understand what I am watching, day after day, more deeply than ever before.\nAt the same time ...\nWere stuck in something of a gray area now. Its wonderful for accuracy, but its terrible for entertaining debate. Theres always a \"Yeah, but\" now. Everything hinges on degrees. You cant just say, \"Joe Flacco is clutch\" without including a disclaimer like, \"Yeah, but if Rahim Moore plays that one deep ball correctly, suddenly Flacco is 4-4 in the previous four postseasons, doesnt have a giant contract, doesnt have a Super Bowl MVP, and isnt leading your Round 2 column right now.\" \n Joe Flacco has played a series of games that have made it seem like hes clutch, but that doesnt mean hes clutch. Or something.\n\n\n\nAnd again, I appreciate 99 percent of the New Era of Sports Thinking. Were unquestionably and undeniably smarter now. But you also read and hear so much more hedging, so much more stammering, so much presenting-both-sides-of-the-picture, so many timid arguments because writers dont want their opinions thrown back in their face later. It also enables certain radio hosts and television hosts to take comically strong stands, one way or the other, simply because everyone else is setting up shop somewhere in the rational middle. They dont have to be right; they just have to stand out. Its much easier to stand out in 2015, thats for sure.\nIts just a weird time. Like so many others with a forum, I find myself calibrating the difference between \"Heres what I actually think\" and \"Heres an educated opinion thats being presented as safely as possible\" pretty much all the time. You want to remain as candid as you can, but you dont want to leave the impression that you were only trying to provoke a reaction, either.\nA good example: When the recent NBA season started, I didnt think LeBron looked right. He just didnt look like LEBRON. Something was different. And it wasnt just his curious weight loss. He didnt have the same energy. He wasnt trying nearly as hard on defense (something that started last season, actually). He played mostly below the rim, not above and \n people. So I went on Colin Cowherds show and mentioned these points, even wondering aloud if there was a chance -- repeat: a chance -- that LeBrons second Cleveland stint could unfold like Albert Pujolss move to Anaheim did. In other words, was it possible that Cleveland acquired the best player of his generation right as he was about to cease being the best player of his generation? Was he injured and not telling us? Was he overwhelmed by all the off-the-court stuff that accompanies coming back home?\nI didnt know WHAT was happening, just that something was happening. I trusted my own eyes. And so I took a few seconds setting up my point (with too many disclaimers), and by the time I blurted out the actual take, it sounded like I was cautiously throwing out a theory over pushing something that I actually believed.\nWhy play it that way? Because I didnt want anyone to blow whatever I said out of proportion, which is (ironically) what happened, anyway.\nLooking back, I should have been more blunt and just owned it. Every instinct I had -- confirmed from 40-plus years of watching basketball and attending games -- told me that \n looked unequivocally different about LeBron James. Common sense told me that Apex LeBron had gone to Apex Sports Heaven -- not just because of LeBrons insane amount of minutes/mileage/wear and tear from his first 11 seasons (especially these last four), but because its impossible to be ALL CAPS GREAT indefinitely. Nobody has pulled it off for more than a few years. Nobody. You cant be the leagues best offensive player AND defensive player for eight months a year, every year, for a solid decade. Even the NBAs G.O.A.T. walked away from professional basketball for 20 months, in his prime, because he was mentally and physically worn down.\n Real greatness has a shelf life.\nAnd LeBron was \n great for six seasons: the last two in Cleveland, then all four in Miami. He played 451 regular-season games, 112 playoff games and nearly 22,000 grueling minutes. He carried teams offensively, absorbed a ludicrous amount of punishment, then logged a superhuman two-way burden in every postseason. He averaged nearly 43 minutes per game in Miamis 67 playoff games from 2011 through 2013. During the lockout season, he played 85 games and more than 3,300 minutes in less than \n Those are miles. Lots of them. And I dont care who you are ... that shit is gonna add up.\nApex LeBrons shelf life ended last summer and that was that. LeBron James will never be quite the same. I watched it happen with Jordan, Bird, Magic, Duncan, Kobe, Julius, Malone, Barkley, Hakeem ... you name it, they hit the exact same invisible tipping point that LeBron hit last June. It happens. Its sports. Its life.\nAnd you know what? Heres a case where I didnt even need to research the numbers, even if nearly all of LeBrons 2014-15 numbers back me up. For six solid years, you could have taken any non-NBA fan to any LeBron game -- your mom, your 7-year-old son, a foreigner, an alien, whomever (as long as they were a blank slate with basketball) -- watched 15 minutes and asked that person to pick out the best player. And I dont care who else was out there. Every time, they would have pointed to LeBron. In 2015, thats not a sure thing anymore. Depending on the night, they might point to Harden, Westbrook, Durant, Davis, Curry ... I dont know. Thats one of the best things about this season. Its an Alpha Dog In Flux season.\nAnyway, it makes me happy that the Eye Test still matters, even if it has become an increasingly undervalued way to discuss sports. When the right numbers back up what youre seeing, even better. Thats the sweet spot. \n And in Joe Flaccos case, that admittedly small seven-game sample size backs up everything I actually watched. For whatever reason, the NFL playoffs roll around and Joe Flacco just LOOKS different.\nMaybe its an optical illusion. Maybe.\n\nSo yeah, I wish Joe Flaccid were showing up in New England on Saturday night, but I am absolutely expecting Joe Flacco. People keep blowing out the whole Ravens/Patriots/nemesis angle, even though the 2009 Pats were the worst Belichick team of the past 12 years (and lost Wes Welker the week before); the 2012 Pats featured a makeshift secondary and a one-armed Gronk (and won anyway); and the 2013 Pats were missing Gronk altogether. This particular Patriots team is \n good and features the best Patriots defense in 10 years, fueled by a suddenly reliable secondary and the one and only Darrelle Revis (Belichicks best free-agent signing ever).\nYou know the recipe for beating the Belichick-Brady Patriots by now. Run the ball, chew up clock and limit possessions. Connect on a couple of deep throws. Pressure Brady up the middle with four guys, make him move from side to side, knock him around, make him uncomfortable. Force a turnover or two. Get a special teams play. Allow the short stuff to the slot guys and tight ends, then pancake them after the catch. And if you end up with a couple extra flags for being too rough, so be it. In other words ... Ravens Football.\nI never thought the 2014-15 Ravens could brew that Patriots/Kryptonite recipe until last weekend in Pittsburgh. Their offensive line was more banged up than Charlie Sheen. Their secondary had more holes than the Mueller report. They looked like a deeply flawed pseudo-contender that hadnt played a great game for four solid months ... until they did. Over everything else, you notice Baltimores big-game players in truly big games. You know Ngata, Suggs and Dumervil are showing up. So are the Smiths (Torrey and Steve). So is Justin Tucker. So is Jacoby Jones. So is John Harbaugh. And so is Joe Flacco. Thats enough for four quarters -- control the lines, avoid turnovers, make two big plays, make your kicks, shift field position with a big return, and suddenly youre winning in the fourth quarter as opposing fans flood each other with \"WTF???\" texts. Thats what the Ravens have been able to do, over and over again, since Harbaugh and Flacco arrived.\nOf course, the Ravens have one other (frightening) variable going for them. Allow two readers to explain ...\nCal in Los Angeles: \"It is impossible to predict the Wonk Team before the playoffs. But the moment you picked Carolina to be the 2014 Wonk Team and dismissed the Ravens, you (by definition) turned the Ravens into the Wonk Team. And now, the Wonk Team heads to New England. You had ONE JOB, Simmons, and that was to NOT JINX THE PATS. You blew it, and were f-ked.\"\nSampo in Palo Alto: \"Im in pre-emptive mourning for the Pats already, and I blame you. The whole season, Ive been terrified of the Ravens -- the classic team that sweats out making the playoffs, then turns on the jets. I crossed my fingers time and again that they would miss the playoffs, purely so the Pats wouldnt have to face them in Round 2, but now its going to happen. You know why it happened? BECAUSE YOU KEPT REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEYRE THE WONK TEAM. YOU KEPT TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU WERENT SCARED OF THEM ... BUT NOW THAT WEVE SEEN ROUND 1, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THE RAVENS ARE F***ING TERRIFYING. That defense is going to give the Pats fits, the pass rush is going to get to Brady, and Flacco will deliver at least 2 50-yard bombs. All you had to do was pretend you were scared of the Ravens and then none of this would have happened. Instead, you jinxed it, and wasted another year of Bradys career. I hate you. I hate you so much.\"\nMy defense: You cant figure out the Wonk Team until after Round 1 or Round 2. For all we know, it still might be Carolina, right? Our recent history of Wonkocity reveals that we never knew until Round 2 with the exception of last year (8-8 San Diego winning in Cincy).\n Round 2, \n Round 2, \n Round 2, \n Round 2, \n Round 2, \n Round 2, \n Round 2, lost in Denver as 7.5-point dogs (\n)\nHeading into this years postseason, the Wonk Team was 20-4 since 2007 -- a stretch that included FOUR Super Bowl wins, one Super Bowl loss (barely), 13 road victories and a stupefying 22-2 record against the spread.\n Thats a great sign for either Baltimore (7-point dogs) or Carolina (11-point dogs), but after watching a banged-up Cam Newton sailing footballs like a hungover intramural QB last weekend, do you really expect Carolina to waltz into Seattle and move the football against the leagues hairiest defense? Me neither.\nThat leaves Baltimore as this months Wonk Team. Yikes.\nYou know what else that means? Recent Wonk Team history gives Baltimore a legitimate chance to complete the Roethlisberger/Brady/Manning road-beating trifecta, then topple Rodgers, Romo or Seattle in the Super Bowl. And if Joe Flacco plays as well in those three games as he played in the last seven? Welcome to the greatest 10-game postseason stretch weve ever seen. Its in play.\nHeres the only thing I know for sure: On Saturday night, at some point, Patriots fans all around the country will text a friend just to say, \"Flacco scares me.\" Their iPhones will change it to \"Flaccid,\" like always. It will be a mistake.\n(And yes, I am belatedly worried.)"}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/divisional-playoffs-simmons-mailbag-patriots-ravens-colts-broncos-cowboys-packers-panthers-seahawks/", "blog_text": "If you missed my Friday-morning piece about Joe Flacco and the wonky Ravens, \n.\nLets rip through some reader emails before we tackle Round 2 picks. As always, these are actual emails from actual readers.\nBS: Just when I didnt think I could be more nervous for Saturdays game. By the way, its really, really, really hard for me to root against Steve Smith. He brought me so much joy over the years as the NFLs answer to Allen Iverson -- a diminutive, overcompetitive ball of energy who punched out multiple teammates, carried himself like a warrior, made us laugh and provided a score of thoughtful sound bites. I love \"villains\" who would immediately become your favorite player the moment they switched to your team. Thats Steve Smith. He would have made a great Patriot.\nYears from now, whenever I want to remember Steve Smith, Ill call up \n for the same Week 1 game in which Jake Delhomme threw four ghastly picks and commenced The Great Jake Delhomme Meltdown of 2009. You can actually see Smith passing through the Seven Stages of Grief as the clip rolls on. It ends with them sitting sadly on the bench, Smith forcing himself to console a shell-shocked Delhomme (but not totally meaning it). If they ever held the Greatest \"Micd Up\" Players Ever tournament, Steve Smith and J.J. Watt would be the no. 1 seeds.\nBS: Is it OK if I dont add \"Beware of Carolinas 20th-Anniversary Tour\" to the Playoff Gambling Manifesto?\nBS: Nope -- Goodell hands it to Bisciotti. Heres an advance clip:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kYNNs2nYLA&t=7m54s\nBS: You forgot about Blake Sheltons \n theme song playing as the camera homes in on the unburned poster. Is it weird that the Watt poster/house fire news story single-handedly swung the MVP vote that I dont have? Im that easy.\nBS: And you left out the piece about how both guys starred for Dallas. Anyway, I hate to be a party pooper ... but Dirk was a much better player than Romo. When I published my NBA book in November 2009, Dirk had already carried the Mavs to the Finals, won an MVP and earned a 39th ranking in my Hall of Fame Pyramid. Nineteen months later, he won the Finals MVP and reinvented his legacy. In 2015, you can still find Dirk chugging along as a borderline 50-40-90 guy on a playoff contender. Hes a top-20 Pyramid guy; you can make an excellent case that hes the fourth-best forward ever (trailing only Bird, Duncan and LeBron in some order).\nMeanwhile, Romo has never played in a conference title game, hes never won an MVP, he hasnt even won 80 games yet (including the playoffs), and he couldnt match Nowitzkis longevity or uniqueness (much less his offensive ceiling). Youd never include Romo in any \"greatest\" conversation, but youd include Dirk in a variety of them -- \"greatest shooter,\" \"greatest offensive 7-footer,\" \"greatest foreign player,\" \"greatest signature scoring move\" and even \"greatest accent that sounds like the perfect cross between urban and German.\"\nBS: Cousin Sals response: \"I like to think of myself not as Manning or Dalton -- but rather a young Daniel LaRusso. I took Reseda by storm. Fought my way through the All-Valley Tournament only to suffer a fluke, debilitating injury when Ryan Lindley pelted my leg with a bevy of pathetically disgraceful interceptions. But rather than skip the finals, I asked Stan Verrett to use his mystical powers to fix my injured wheel. The ship is righted. Jump onboard as I crane kick the crap out of your bookie this weekend. \n\"\n(PS: The Cuz picked Dallas and a Seattle/Denver tease this weekend. Lets hope we dont have to get him a body bag.)\nBS: I wanted to make sure that this was a historically awful trade, so heres how it lays out. Richardson bombed in Indy, played one snap in last weekends Round 1 game and recently earned the headline \"\n.\" The Colts would have been better keeping that first-rounder and drafting a chauffeur for Jim Irsay. As for the Browns, they landed the no. 26 overall pick via Indy, then dealt it along with no. 83 to Philly for no. 22 ... and took Manziel, who turned out to be A LIAR AND AN ALCOHOLIC!!!!! (Sorry, I was auditioning for \n again.) Philly flipped no. 83 to Houston for no. 101 and no. 141. Houston picked Louis Nix, who missed the season with an injury. Philly picked cornerback Jaylen Watkins and defensive end Taylor Hart, described as \"nonentities\" in \n about Philly whiffing on its 2014 draft.\n(Translation: Everyone lost! That is one baaaaaaaaad trade.)\n\n\nBS: I realized this only after picking them to cover 4 in Indy without A.J. Green, a boneheaded move that earned the following comments from readers: \"Can we have you tested for drugs?\" ... \"Picking Dalton to win on the road in the playoffs is like putting an elevator in an outhouse; it just doesnt belong\" ... \"Can we officially change the phrase from One and Done to One and Dalton?\" ... \"Did you throw that pick because you didnt want to be 4-0 heading into Round 2 and have the Pats blow 11-0 for you?\" ... \"I want to be your bookie -- seriously I will book your bets\" ... and \"Ive been reading your column long enough that I used to print it out from Page 2 so that I could read it during poops as an undergrad. ANDY DALTON!? ON THE ROAD!? IN THE PLAYOFFS!?\"\nWhat really happened: I found out Green was scratched 30 minutes before the column and stupidly thought, \n When Cincy ran its first pass play for some beefy white guy that Id never heard of, I knew it was over. Lets add this to the Playoff Gambling Manifesto: \"If your no. 1 rule is Dont take a shaky QB on the road, and you apply that rule for Ryan Lindley but DONT apply that rule to Andy Dalton without A.J. Green, then you might need to start downing Adderall like Haloti Ngata before you make next weeks picks.\"\n\n\nBS: The Mueller Report couldnt find any evidence of this.\n\n\nBS: So I guess youre not excited about the 2024 Summer Olympics?\nBS: Come on, anytime you can put the Summer Olympics in a city thats way too cramped to host it, has traffic and subway-related overcrowding problems already, doesnt have nearly enough facilities, has a legacy of being comically provincial AND a legacy of taking far too long to finish massive rebuilding projects, houses a major league baseball team playing downtown at the exact same time, and doesnt want to host the Olympics anyway ... only the bid is being driven by someone in the construction business, which seems incredibly self-serving given all the construction thats about to take place ... I mean, dont you have to go for it? What could go wrong?\nBS: Congrats to Ross for being the 3,000th reader to send me some variation of this joke. Is it weird that \"A Gronking To Remember\" gave me more confidence that the Patriots could make the Super Bowl? Cant you see Lacey Noonan at media day trying to get a one-on-one with Gronk as three middle-aged reporters in Hawaiian shirts look on awkwardly?\nBS: That cant be true. (Looking it up.) My God, \n!\n\n\nBS: You dont have to sell me on the power of Bananas. Hes the Michael Jordan of Americas fifth professional sport. Did you know we invited him to Grantlands third-anniversary party last summer and asked him to prepare a toast if only because nobody gives better toasts than Johnny Bananas? And that theres video of this? Without further ado, I present to you Johnny Bananass Third-Anniversary Toast, which borrows heavily from the Navy SEALs and might sound a lot like the toast he eventually gave on this weeks \n episode:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6lXlDKM_g8\nBS: Stop trying to rile me up. I know what youre doing.\nBS: It cant be ruled out. Page 55 of the Mueller Report lays out six different times in February when someone working for Goodell knew about evidence that Rice knocked his wife out, including this tidbit: \"On February 21, [NFL VP Adolpho] Birch emailed Goodell, stating, Media today is reporting that there is also video of him delivering the blow that knocked her out.\" And yet, Goodell was allegedly blindsided by the contents of the second elevator video? (Oh, man ... now Im getting riled up ... )\nBS: Intriguing theory! Especially during the same week the NFL released the \n, a league-funded but \"independent\" investigation that chronicled a heroic four-month inquiry by the NFL to desperately avoid figuring out what happened in that elevator.\n(IMPORTANT NOTE: SKIP TO THE NEXT BOLDED EMAIL IF YOU DONT CARE ABOUT THE MUELLER REPORT.)\nThe report spent an inordinate amount of time trying to disprove an Associated Press article from April 9 (and yes, the AP \n that its standing by the story) that painted the NFLs investigation as incompetent and naive (but apparently blameless), and, of course, neglecting to answer questions including:\nThe Ravens came off worse than anyone -- instead of volunteering their evidence, basically, they held on to it and hoped Goodell would never ask. (And he didnt.) Its impossible to finish the Mueller Report without thinking that either (a) Goodell and his direct reports are spectacularly incompetent, or (b) Goodell did a favor for his buddy Bisciotti by intentionally burying his head in the sand so Rices punishment wouldnt be that onerous. And its clear now that the Ravens need to start firing some of the people who bungled this mess from their end. Maybe the players havent entered the Colossal Karma Payback zone, but the organization certainly has.\nBS: Yeah, the system is called \"gambling.\"\n\n\nBS: (Searching for a comeback ... )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBS: I thought it was fascinating that Lions fans from New York to Shanghai went through the same thought process. Hold on ...\n\n\nBS: The bright side for Lions fans is that its hard to get credit for being a tortured fan base without a few heartbreaking/ridiculous/possibly criminal losses. Now, when people discuss the sad fate of Lions fans, theyll mention the Picked-Up Flag game within the first sentence. And when theyre remembering that game, they wont mention Caldwell incredibly NOT going for it on the ensuing fourth-and-1, or Sam Martins 10-yard punt,\n or the defense giving up a fourth-and-6, or Stafford fumbling twice on the same season-saving drive. Plus, you got hosed during the Year of Goodell! Whats better than that?\nBS: See? Cheer up, Lions fans! You can always bounce your grandkids on your lap 40 years from now and tell them your team got hosed during the Worst Commissioner Ever Heat Check season! CLEAR OUT FOR GOODELL, HES RED HOT RIGHT NOW!\n\n\nBS: OK, so that was mean.\nBS: I hope we remember it as the Touch Football era ... but I have a feeling well be calling it the Concussion Era. Theres just no way around it. I mean, its 2015 and were still watching football players seemingly get concussed during games (like Ben Roethlisberger and Heath Miller last weekend), then improbably \n \n. What a shocker -- Roethlisberger wandered out of a playoff game looking Wooderson-level dazed, abruptly returned and immediately threw a dreadful interception into double coverage. Who could have seen that coming?!?!? Its like the last decade of research never happened! Keep getting dem checks, National Football League.\n\n\nBS: Ive always loved this idea -- we would be artificially manufacturing our own \"Nobody Believes In Us\" scenarios. And yes, if the Patriots had picked Baltimore over Indy as their Round 2 opponent, I would have flipped out.\nBS: Um ... I mean ... I guess that was a compliment?\nBS: That Poo Pourri ad has been replaced by a never-ending loop of Drew Butler shanking punts to a skittish Brenton Bersin. That reminds me, heres the Shakeys Pizza Watch coming out of Round 1: the Lions-Cowboys officiating crew picking up that P.I. flag AFTER it has been announced (never seen that before) ... Todd Haleys crap game plan for Round 1 (and Todd Haley in general) ... the inevitable Boom Herron fumble ... \n from Sundays Lions-Cowboys game ... Cam Newtons body language and accuracy ... Peyton Manning in cold weather ... Aaron Rodgers with a bad wheel in cold weather ... Tom Brady in cold weather ... any old or injured QB in cold weather ... Logan Thomas (because if he cant beat out Ryan Lindley, then wow) ... Marvin Lewiss playoff resum\n (0-6 in playoffs, never scored 17-plus points, lost to Sanchez and T.J. Yates, \n, never CLOSE to winning) ... Big Bens concussion \"test\" ... T.Y. Hiltons case of the dropsies ... Jason Garretts psychotic victory smile thats vaguely reminiscent of Brody losing his mind during Season 1 of \n.\nBS: Yes. But not THE most awkward celebration of all time.\nBS: Yup, these are my readers. Lets get to the Round 2 picks.\n(Home teams in CAPS.)\nThree Playoff Manifesto rules in play here: \"Dont Pick A Road Underdog Unless You Think They Have A Genuine Chance To Win,\" \"Beware Of Aging QBs In Cold Weather,\" and \"Beware Of The Wonk Team.\" For the record, I hate cold-weather playoff games for home teams. It murders the crowd. Just takes \nem right out. Everyone is freezing their asses off, everyones covered in thick jackets and scarves and ski masks and huge hats, everyones wearing heavy gloves or mittens so their hands cant generate any noise, and everyones faces are too frozen to cheer loudly. Its like playing the game in a neutral field. Eleven years ago, a superb Patriots team nearly blew a Round 2 home game to Tennessee because of the freezing conditions ... and would have, if it werent for the great Adam Vinatieri kicking the football/rock 46 yards for the game-winning field goal. Heres how my buddy J-Bug (a longtime Pats season-ticket holder) \n in my ensuing column:\nThats a home-field advantage? Even if 2015 Pats-Ravens wont be as bone-chillingly cold as 2004 Pats-Titans, temperatures will dip into the teens once night falls. That kills the atmosphere at least a little. And if you dont think Im worried about my late-thirties QB getting knocked around on a rock-hard field, then you dont know me well enough. Feels like a 20-17 type of game -- one of those games that gets decided by a pass-interference play, a turnover, a special teams return and a long field goal. And what really frightens me is that the Ravens are better built to win a game like that. I want to throw up. In Belichick We Trust.\nYour classic Gus Ramsey Game, named after my buddy Gus for all the times hed study a football game between a good-to-great defense playing home against a bad-to-shaky offense and wonder, \"Seriously, how many points are they gonna score in this game?\" That minus-11 seems high until you remember how banged up Cam Newton looked last weekend, or how bad his body language looked (little-known fact: It was so bad that the Cleveland Cavaliers are now thinking about signing him), or how many of his passes sailed away from his targets. You cant play that way in Seattle, and you definitely cant play that way against Seattles ball-hawking secondary. Throw in Beast Mode running all over Carolinas secretly shaky run defense, sprinkle in some CenturyLink Field acoustics, add two backbreaking Russell Wilson plays and a defensive TD, and ... well ...\nSo Aaron Rodgers is nursing a partially torn calf muscle in frigid weather against a talented Cowboys team with a top-five QB whos 8-0 on the road ... and the line is higher than four points? I dont get it.\nMy biggest fear with this pick: I also could have written \"So Tony Romo is nursing a bad back in frigid weather against a loaded Packers offense thats 8-0 at Lambeau ... and the line is less than seven points? I dont get it.\"\nMy second-biggest fear with this pick: The Cowboys looked a little too happy to be there after pulling that Lions game out of their asses. Not sure you should be reacting to a backdoor Round 1 victory at home like you just won the Super Bowl. That scared me. But this feels like a tight game if only because Lambeau wont totally feel like Lambeau with the bundled-up fans shivering their asses off. And no, Im not ready to officially add this axiom to the Playoff Gambling Manifesto yet: \"Anytime you have two relatively close playoff teams battling in booger-freezing weather, and you can grab more than four points, just do it without overthinking it.\" But if the Ravens and Cowboys cover this weekend? Then yes. (Thinking.) You know what? Screw it.\nYou know it, you love it, youve won money from it ... whats better than everyone overreacting because a flawed playoff team looked better than it actually is in Round 1? The Colts have a lousy running game. They make way too many mistakes. They were absolutely \n during the season by high-caliber offenses. They were 2014s Good Bad Team -- a.k.a. the team that looks good against everyone except another good team. And if youre picking them to cover in Denver, youre banking on two things: an iconic, out-of-his-mind, LeBron-dropping-48-on-the-2007-Pistons-type performance from Andrew Luck (cant be ruled out) and a creaky Peyton Manning falling apart in not-that-cold weather to the point that youll get flashbacks to this ...\nI dont think the Colts can run on Denver even a little, and I think Denver CAN run on the Colts. I think Luck makes mistakes when you pressure him ... and Denver will be able to pressure him. I think we forget how good Denver is when they have the Thomas Brothers, Emmanuel Sanders and C.J. Anderson humming together. I dont like laying points in playoff games between two relatively equal teams ... but these two teams arent relatively equal.

Before my Round 3 picks, lets tackle actual emails from actual readers.\n\n\nBS: Fantastic question. First of all, Manning isnt going away -- if he leaves football, hes making up that whopping salary with a TV gig (and hed be the highest-paid TV guy since Madden, not to mention the biggest sure thing since Strahan), as well as even MORE commercials. Given what weve seen from Joe Montana, Brett Favre and others, as well as the post-1998 Michael Jordan, sponsors wont care if Manning retires. His Q rating wont budge. As long as hes likable, theyll be cutting him checks. \nAs for active players, Rodgers is like the Ryan Reynolds of NFL pitchmen -- hes just going to keep getting gigs three years after we realize that its not working out. I cant see him losing pole position, though. Wilson and Luck arent ready yet. Brady doesnt want it. J.J. Watt isnt recognizable enough. Theres one dark horse for the Manning Alpha Dog Ad Spot, though. If the Patriots somehow win two more games, I mean ...\n\n\nBS: Combined with my previous mailbag answer, were suddenly battling so many different jinxing implications that I might have to cleanse myself in a hot bath, cover myself in rosary beads and give myself a concussion to forget this whole sequence happened. This is NOT the Year of Gronk. (Monotone voice.) On to Indianapolis. On to Indianapolis. On to Indianapolis.\n\n\nBS: No question. Its her, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne Hathaway and Jenny McCarthy right now. If that were the new cast for \n, theyd have to change the name of the show to \nBS: You just mentioned one of the two non-football reasons that I am frightened of the Colts on Sunday.\nBS: And heres the other non-football reason. It scares the crap out of me that the Colts have been ripping off Flairs iconic 1980s \"Rolex-wearing\" interview ...\n... with safety Sergio Brown as their postgame locker-room victory routine.\nYou know what Clairvoyant Bill doesnt like? The thought of Indy shocking the Patriots this weekend, Sergio Brown doing that speech one more time, then Super Bowl week rolling around and Ric Flair showing up with the announcement that, if the Colts win the whole thing, RIC FLAIR will be doing that locker-room routine with Brown. CLAIRVOYANT BILL IS FRIGHTENED OF THIS ENTIRE HYPOTHETICAL SEQUENCE. ITS THE KIND OF GOOFY SUBPLOT THAT ALWAYS SEEMS TO HAPPEN TO UPSTART TEAMS THAT MAKE AND WIN SUPER BOWLS. MY CAPS LOCK IS NOT BROKEN. DAMMIT. DAMMIT. I HATE THIS RIC FLAIR THING. DAMMIT. DAMMIT!!!!!\nBS: Yup. Pretty much.\nBS: Adam Vinatieri is in the building! Get em, Adam! Go get em, baby! Oh, oh, oh ... what is he doing??? What the hell is going on here?????\nBS: Id set the over/under at 32.5 percent, and Im going under. Hopefully Careys struggles are leading to CBS dumping Mike Carey and hiring Jerome Boger, then dressing him up like Tim Meadows from \n for every ruling.\nBS: I thought it was a copy-paste mistake, but we searched my reader e-mail account for \"Shanghai\" since December and THREE different \"Mike from Shanghai\" email addresses came up. How are there three Mikes from Shanghai who read my column? How is there anyone from Shanghai reading my column? The Shanghai Sports Guy must really be slipping.\nBS: (Afraid to say anything.)\nBS: (Nervously glancing around.)\nBS: (Unable to breathe.)\nBS: Wow, you went with Azinger and left me David Duvals career-ending double-fist-pump debacle? A curious move by Andrew from Toronto!\nStill, Rachel in Edmonton sent me the funniest celebration on YouTube -- a gamer battling (and losing) to a champagne bottle after winning one of the worlds biggest e-sports tournaments. This is just remarkable footage. I almost didnt embed it because Im worried you wont be able to concentrate on the rest of the mailbag now. Whatever.\nBS: Bostons Olympic slogan should definitely be, \"Boston 2024: NOBODY BELIEVES IN US!!!\"\nBS: Its certainly better than about 20 other things he could give them. Why Grantland hasnt launched \"Story Time With Johnny Bananas\" is one of the great mysteries of life. By the way, Ive been watching Americas Fifth Pro Sport (\n) and think we should induct Nany into The Bunim/Murray Hall of Fame if only for these two moments: (1) She couldnt figure out which \"ex\" MTV was pairing her with because there were too many possibilities, and (2) she said the words, \"And me not having any self-respect -- why does this bother you?\" Nany is the J.J. Watt of \n -- every season, shes a little more superhuman. Lets hope they never meet.\nBS: A rarely seen short-term jinx coupled with a long-term nobody-believes-in-you reverse jinx. Stop toying with my emotions, Taylor in Patchogue. And pass the salmon, Seattles defense.\nBS: I checked it out and ... um ... NO! I am not a freemason! Or, am I secretly a freemason and never realized it, but its been unwittingly seeping out of me? What the hell????? Why did you plant this in my head? How did I become a freemason? What are my next steps? Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!\nBS: That was called \"The Denver Broncos and coach John Fox have mutually agreed to part ways.\"\nBS: Agree -- that was the defining \"Im old, Im banged-up, get me out of here\" sequence. But the degree of difficulty for Mannings 2012-14 comeback doesnt get enough credit. Four neck surgeries???? Expecting three healthy Denver seasons from him, in retrospect, was more than a little unrealistic. Its a little like Kobes 2014-15 season right now -- doesnt it seem foolish that we thought Kobe could return from a torn Achilles tendon and what amounted to being a 20-month layoff, at age 36, with over 55,000 NBA minutes/miles on him, as if nothing ever happened? I always revered a then-crippled Larry Bird for gutting his way through those last two Celtics seasons with the 25-pound back brace; it wasnt much different from what Manning just did. Seems like we keep forgetting this.\nBS: That might have been the longest and most eloquent backhanded compliment in mailbag history. But Manning was better than youre saying. Every great QB has flaws. Marino and Warner couldnt move. Rodgers can be beaten up, like Montana back in the day. Elway and Favre were too careless. Eli Manning couldnt find the giant horseshoe that was crammed up his butt until January and February. You could nitpick every great guy.\n\n\nBS: TEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-BOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nBS: Youre not missing anything! TEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-BOWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!! For Gods sake, we just lost two more starting QBs (Kyle Orton and probably Manning), and we have more up-in-the-air-QB teams (Cleveland, Tampa, Tennessee, Buffalo, Jacksonville, the Jets, maybe Denver, maybe Washington) than incoming rookie saviors. The QB pool is like the beach in Southern California: It recedes a little more every year. I refuse to believe that Tebow is worse than five Opening Day starters next season. He won a playoff game!\n\n\nBS: Helping your case: Two different reporters disagreed and said \n, just a strain in one or both legs. But if NFL teams are supposed to report every injury, why didnt the Broncos report Mannings \"torn\" quadriceps? What about my three-team tease that Denver blew on Sunday because I didnt know that Sure Thing Denver had a one-legged quarterback? The NFL fines teams for not reporting injuries, but it didnt fine Denver for not reporting THE biggest injury? Regardless, lets stop piling on Peyton. The man had an extraordinary career.\n\n\nBS: Seriously, lets scale it back a notch.\nBS: I went and found those hyperlinks for you, America. Just because I love you. Youd also have to consider the following guys to crash the Final Eight: Stafford, \n (this is great), \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n (just for the Brandon Marshall moments) ... I mean, hes right. This really could be the next Grantland Bracket.\nBS: That would be a hilarious \n sketch -- Michaels and Collinsworth saying increasingly crazy praise-worthy things about Goodell as the camera scaled back to reveal NFL and NBC executives pointing guns at them. Dont worry, I am getting Al Michaels on a \n soon. Were getting the real story. Maybe they didnt have time to read the whole Mueller Report. Maybe they were told to do that ... or else. Maybe they just werent educated enough about the whole story. But to briskly read through the \"highlights\" of Goodells \"exoneration\" from the Mueller Report without mentioning all the different ways that same report made him look (fill in a word: incompetent, bumbling, shady, nefarious, deceitful), or mentioning that the report specifically said that Goodell didnt tell the truth in his September 10 memo to the 32 owners ... I mean, come on.\nBS: Thats a really smart point. And theres also a chance -- like Brady in 2001 and 2003 -- that Wilson COULD do more, but hes a little limited by the available receiver options. Hes a superb quarterback. Im terrified of him. Theres only one Wilson flaw right now: Every interview makes me wonder if hes the lost Will Smith-Jada Pinkett kid. Hes so serenely perfect and well mannered that it creeps me out.\n \nYou: Sorry, man, I just farted.\nRussell (smiling): Thats fine.\nYou: Roll down your window if you want.\nRussell (smiling): Its OK, dont worry about it.\nYou: You havent farted this whole trip. Have you ever farted?\nRussell (smiling): Not really.\n(Dead silence.)\nYou: Hey, you hungry? Should we stop for food?\nRussell (smiling): Yeah, if you want.\nYou: Are you hungry?\nRussell (smiling): It doesnt matter, whatever.\n(Dead silence.)\nBS: Its way, way, way, way up there. My quickie take: That was the correct interpretation of an excruciatingly bad rule. But the Cowboys didnt play well enough to win, either. You have to BEAT Green Bay in Lambeau. Remember that third-and-1 near the end of the first half, in two-down territory, when they threw an incompletion, got the penalty on the field goal try, then missed the field goal and allowed Green Bay to get three points out of it? Thats when they blew the game. If you cant get one yard with DeMarco Murray in two tries, then you dont deserve to win. They got too cute. I thought the right team won. Rodgers owned the second half; even if the Dez catch counts, Rodgers still rolls down and scores. The first half was when Dallas could have put the Packers away -- or come close.\nBS: Serious question: Could Chris Christie be intentionally trying to lower everyones opinion of him so he can rally back as 2016s \"Nobody Believes In Me\" candidate? This is all leading to our Nobody Believed In Him president lighting the torch in our Nobody Believed In Us Olympic city. I can feel it.\nBS: And you left out the best part: Everyone who wagered on the Cowboys +6 clinched their bet thanks to Green Bays failed two-point conversion from earlier. (That was one of my favorite gambling wins in awhile.) I felt bad for Dez in this respect -- if he hadnt made the mistake of dipping the ball against the ground for 0.00004 seconds and Dallas had somehow held off Rodgers for the emotional win, that wouldve become a LEGENDARY catch. An all-timer, even. He did everything right ... except for that split second when he reached for the end zone.\n\n\nBS: Had Todd Haley given up on his running game, spread the field and chucked it every down against that sketchy Ravens secondary like the Patriots did, wed probably be talking about Steelers-Patriots right now. Blame Todd Haley! Hes the Percocet-popping grandma in this scenario, not me!\nBS: Maybe that should be his nickname -- New Years Joe. Thats the funniest Flacco email I received last weekend except for the guy who spent a paragraph comparing Flacco to Michael Myers, right down to his \"dead eyes.\" When you can be successfully compared to a fictional serial killer, you know youre making an impact as a playoff QB. New Years Joe Flacco, you still scare the shit out of me.\nBS: Theres no question. That throw reminded me of Jason Terrys back-breaking 3 in the 2011 NBA Finals: I AM JASON F- - - ING TERRY AND F- - -  IT, I AM JUST SHOOTING THIS!!!!!\nTotally in character, just like Flacco going for the kill was totally in character. That Ravens-Pats game couldnt have ended any other way. And actually, it didnt end that way -- the Patriots screwed up their clock-wasting strategy, forgot to run sweeps and somehow left the Ravens with a punt return and a Hail Mary. (Important note: Every Pats fan has quietly agreed to never discuss those 99 seconds again. Its like how fans of \n conveniently forget the Italian American parade episode during every \"David Chase is a genius\" conversation. Those 99 seconds never happened.)\n\n\n\n\nBS: Patriots fans are a little gooey right now. I apologize.\n\n\nBS: Heres what Gladwell had to say ...\n\"I think Leos situation is not dissimilar to the Jamaican-sprinting question. Jamaica, a country one-tenth the size of Cuba, has now produced the worlds best sprinters for the past generation in numbers that defy all logic. Here, for example, are the results of the high school boys 100-meter finals from last years Jamaican Boys & Girls Athletics Championships:\n\"For those who are not track fans, I should point out that this final is probably faster than the ADULT national finals in virtually every country in the world except the United States. So why are the Jamaicans so good? There are many reasons, but the simplest is that the effect of peers on high performance is REALLY strong. In Jamaica, EVERYONE sprints. There are 20 heats in the 100-meter regional championships. And because everyone sprints, and the average quality of sprinting is so high, everyones expectations are raised accordingly. The psychological ceiling on elite performance if you are a high school sprinter in Kingston is, like, a foot higher than if you are a high school sprinter in America. Leo is the Jamaican sprinter of ladies men. The average Don Juan gets to practice his A-game maybe once a month. Leo cant EVER take a night off. Hes been competing with the very best for 20 years. I dont know if he remembers what its like not to be charming.\"\n(Did that settle it?)\n\n\nBS: My mother is 100 percent Italian -- Id like to thank Henry for being able to replicate, almost to the word, something my Uncle Ricky would have said at Thanksgiving dinner after five glasses of chianti. This was amazing. By the way, we might be in range.\n\n\nBS: Were definitely in range.\nBS: Getting closer ...\n\n\nBS: Were circling. Just sit tight. Were landing in a second.\nBS: Yup, these are my readers. Lets hit the conference-title picks.\nYour New England red flags: no pass rush, no running game, too much offensive line upheaval, Vontae Davis shutting down Edelman, Luck catching fire, Vinatieris Possible Revenge, the unstoppable Sergio Brown/Ric Flair Rolex-Wearing Karma Train, the difficulty of pulling off two Kitchen Sink Games in a row, T.Y. Hilton running around and doing T.Y. Hilton things, and good luck (not Andrew) failing to carry over from last weekend. Remember, Baltimore caused three fumbles in traffic and the Patriots recovered all three (two because of luck, one because Shane Vereens knee was down for 0.2222 seconds). That may have been the last great Brady-Belichick win. Its possible.\nThen again, the Colts cant run the ball, either. They dont have that scary/shifty/sneaky pass-catching back who routinely kills the 2014 Pats. They cant cover tight ends. (I dont need to say it.) Their gifted young QB puts the ball up for grabs two to three times per game (this time against an excellent Pats secondary). Theyve been positively pwned by the Pats during the Luck era (including two months ago). They may have just lucked out in the first two rounds -- no A.J. Green or Jermaine Gresham in Round 1, then a crippled/aging/useless Manning and an impotent Broncos coaching staff in Round 2. Are we sure they arent a little happy to be there? Are we sure Gronk isnt going to just throw them out of the club? Wouldnt the Colts be the worst Super Bowl team in years?\nHeres the trump card: I watched a lot of Luck these past two years. If you dont pressure him, he morphs into a freaking assassin. Ask the Chiefs fans what happened last January. Ask the Bengals fans what happened two weeks ago. Unpressured Luck just keeps coming. The Pats wont generate nearly enough pressure to bother him. That means Luck is gonna hang around and hang around and hang around and hang around and hang around ...\nFirst of all, thats a disrespectful line. Green Bay can run and throw with the best of them. Thats too many points for an elite offense on the road. Vegas might as well fly \"NOBODY BELIEVES IN YOU, GREEN BAY!\" banners over CenturyLink Field. Second, Seattles admittedly splendid defense hasnt played a good-to-great quarterback SINCE WEEK SIX. Seems relevant. Third, theres a decent chance that were witnessing Rodgerss \"By the time this season is over, youll be wondering if Im the best ever\" season. Its in play. If anyone can beat Seattle in Seattle, its him ... but I think he falls juuuuuuuuuuuuuuust short. Seattle is due for one postseason scare, right? Besides, the Playoff Gambling Manifesto specifically warns us to \"Beware of the Easy Same-Day Two-Team Tease.\" Everyone and their degenerate brother is going to be teasing the Pats and Seahawks this weekend. Someone has to screw it up. This feels like a classic in the making. Im giddy. Enjoy the weekend."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/2015-nba-trade-value-part-1/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/super-bowl-mailbag-seattle-seahawks-new-england-patriots/", "blog_text": "You know what really sucks? This is an especially good Super Bowl matchup. The big-picture stakes: Either the Seahawks will become the first back-to-back champs in 10 years or the Patriots will win their fourth Super Bowl and vault their coach and quarterback to another level historically. The small-picture stakes: No Super Bowl matchup has \n been tighter. We started out with Seattle favored by 2.5 points; now, New England is favored by one.\nOf course, we spent the last two weeks talking about cheating and footballs and PSI. Physics professors got involved. Multiple media members embarrassed themselves, breathlessly reported bad info or came off like complete hypocrites, although I guess thats nothing new. There was one 24-hour span last week, right after Belichick seemingly threw Brady under the bus and a rattled Brady rambled in front of reporters for about 15 minutes too long, when it seemed like the Belichick-Brady dynasty was actually imploding. The weekend rolled around, the moment passed, the entire Patriots team shifted into F.U. mode, and that was that.\nNow its the Friday before the Super Bowl ... and we dont really know much more than we knew 12 days ago.\nWe know for sure that Brady likes his footballs inflated to the lowest legal PSI (12.5).\nWe know that Bradys 12 footballs were \"approved\" about two hours before the Colts game, that referee Walt Anderson never wrote the PSI levels of those balls down, and that Anderson may have touched each football like he was feeling melons at a farmers market. \nWe know that a \"person of interest\" (a Patriots employee) took the first batch of approved footballs for a 90-second bathroom trip that was found on video within a week ... you know, by the same league that literally went out of its way for nearly seven months NOT to find a casino elevator video of a Ravens star punching his fiancee in the face.\nWe know that it takes about 90 seconds to either take a piss and wash your hands or deflate 11 footballs by just a little.\nWe know they played the Colts game in 50-degree weather, in a driving downpour, and we know that \n highlighted a physics expert proving that a semi-dramatic weather change would absolutely alter PSI from \"legal\" to \"not quite legal.\"\nWe know game officials touched the footballs before and after EVERY first-half play.\nWe know they changed to 12 new footballs at halftime, and after they did, the Patriots scored 28 points and sent the Colts packing.\nAnd we know that Bill Belichick and Bob Kraft did their own internal investigations, then put their credibility on the line -- in separate press conferences -- by insisting the Patriots did nothing wrong and essentially daring the NFL to come after them.\nSo unless an incriminating email/text message/phone conversation is unearthed, or unless a cheating Patriots employee sells his story for big bucks, well never know what actually happened. Thats my prediction: eternal ambiguity. Well never know. Just like well never know whether JFK was really killed by a lone gunman, well never know if David Stern suspended Michael Jordan for gambling, and well never know how they screwed up \n. And for a few days, Patriots fans didnt totally know what to do. After all, nobody sets out to root for Americas accepted villain, right? Who wants to root for the real-life Cobra Kai? Who wants to come to grips with the fact that, for an entire generation of football fans under 30, Belichicks Patriots are the modern version of Al Daviss \"Just Win Baby\" Raiders?\nIt takes a few days to adjust ... and then its fine. You get defensive. You turn into a \n. You embrace that us-against-the-world mentality. Over these last 12 days, I heard from more buddies and family members and long-lost friends than for any Patriots Super Bowl since the one in 2002 -- people either poking fun at me for supporting \"cheaters\" or playing the \"Were getting railroaded, WE ARE WINNING AND EVERYONE CAN F OFF\" card. Two extremes. No in-between.\nAnd I tried not to let that affect this years Super Bag. I really did. But I cant say that I totally succeeded. As always, these are actual emails from actual readers.\n\n\nBS: Lets answer these questions in reverse order. First, Goodell has screwed up just about every \"investigation\" hes done -- profoundly, unbelievably, and historically -- which means wed have a better chance with Ballghazi if Scooby and Shaggy were involved. So, if Goodell handles this in typically Goodellian fashion, hell drag his feet after the \"incident\" (already happened), \n, go into hiding for the next two to three weeks (bank on that, too), then belatedly make a disastrous decision in late February that will get annihilated by the media and football fans. And that will be followed by someone protesting (probably the Colts, who definitely lost by 38 points because the footballs were 7 percent lighter than usual) and then a second investigation to make sure that Goodell made the right decision, followed by an \"independent\" arbiter redoing that decision and everyone remaining unhappy afterward. Thats how he handles things. Basically, Im predicting that Roger Goodell pulls a Goodell.\nIf Adam Silver were in charge, he would have said before media day, \"It will take me two weeks to figure out what happened, but if we find out that the Patriots cheated, then Im taking their first-round pick and fining them $1 million. And I might also suspend people. I am taking this VERY seriously. Just, everyone, please be careful -- I dont want our players and coaches accused of cheating without any actual evidence. Its wrong.\" Also, there wouldnt have been multiple leaks per week to NFL reporters whom the league is trying to butter up again after double-crossing them last summer with Rice scandal info (you know who you are). Silvers administration doesnt leak stuff.\nMy honest, I-swear-on-my-new-puppys-life-that-I-feel-this-way take: Brady likes throwing footballs that arent too tight, so they prepare them as legally-not-too-tight as possible, and maybe they were smart enough to know that inclement weather would make those footballs even a little less tight. This explanation has ALWAYS made the most sense. If any chicanery happened, heres your best possibility: NFL referees rarely (if ever) measure the balls (instead doing the farmers market-melons routine), so the Patriots inflated them lower than the limit and hoped Anderson wouldnt notice. If he noticed, then they would have inflated them more, but he never noticed.\nIts just not that interesting, and since we live in a Conspiracy-Loving Era -- believe me, nobody loves conspiracies more than I do -- its more entertaining to imagine Sully the Ball Boy sneaking into a bathroom and deflating footballs because Brady and Belichick gave him a suitcase of cash and a free Lexus.\nRegardless, America wouldnt have cared about this story nearly as much if any other NFL team were involved. Football teams cheat all the time. (\n.) Football teams constantly search for edges. (Why does just about every head coach and offensive coordinator STILL cover their faces when calling a play? You think theyre trying to hide a pimple from HD cameras?) The post-Spygate Patriots are like a cheating spouse who got caught, repaired his/her marriage, never got caught again ... but anytime anything seems suspicious after that, the other spouse just freaks out and assumes the worst. Thats why this story kept going for two solid weeks.\nBS: That already happened. You just missed it. You were probably in the bathroom for 90 seconds.\nBS: I couldnt be prouder. I always wanted to root for an NFL team that behaves like Ben Affleck during the first 75 minutes of \n. Its a dream come true.\nBS: Mike D. just stumbled into my worst fear after a Patriots win (if they win) -- waking up next week on West Coast time (6:30 a.m. range, after the East Coast workday already started), checking my cell phone and just seeing a string of emails with \"TMZ\" in the subject heading. Actually, thats my worst fear every morning, anyway.\n(Wait, did I just give my friends a guaranteed way to mess with me in the morning whenever they want? Dammit! DELETE! DELETE!)\nBS: Youre right. Messing around \n with footballs to crush a mediocre Colts team that you would have crushed anyway, or illegally taping Eric Manginis sideline signals when hes Eric Freaking Mangini ... I mean, that IS like a rich lady shoplifting a pack of Duracells. Totally unnecessary. Thats why I think they didnt do it twice. Once, yes. Twice, no.\n\n\nBS: (Still hoping its a Baby Ruth bar.)\nBS: Thats great company! Forty-three combined world championships! Lets ask Bills fans: Would you rather be compared to the Vikings and Browns ... or the Patriots, Yankees and Lakers? YEAH, I THOUGHT SO!!!!! Its us against the world, baby!\nBS: OK, maybe its not always that much fun rooting for the real-life nWo.\nBS: Congrats to Paul for insulting my team (Im assuming) and my intelligence (because I have no idea what Die Fledermaus was/is). Couldnt you have just gone with a Tom Cruise movie? By the way, thats how many emails I got making fun of the Patriots -- people even used operetta putdowns. What an unforgettable 12 days.\nBS: Great question. And sadly, I have a 9-and-a-half-year-old daughter and knew the answer almost immediately. My best-case-scenario Katy song: \"Roar.\" Check out these lyrics:\n(THAT WAS THE PATS DURING THE FIRST FIVE DAYS OF DEFLATEGATE.)\n(YEAH, NFL, WE LET YOU PUSH US PAST THE BREAKING POINT!)\n(THATS THE SECOND BELICHICK PRESS CONFERENCE.)\n(TRANSLATION: WERE UP 13-3 AT HALFTIME!)\n(\"ROAR\" RHYMES WITH FOUR, AS IN ... FOUR SUPER BOWLS!)\nSo whats the worst-case-scenario Katy song? That would be \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.),\" a song about girls who broke the partying rules on the previous Friday night and ... yup ... decided to break the rules again. Oh, and it includes this part:\n(Lets just move on. Quickly.)\n\n\nBS: I think we need to be a little more careful with the phrase \"Pulling a Clemens.\"\n\n\nBS: You got it, Vikings fans. Its the least I could do.\nBS: Biggest winners from the past 12 days: the Colts (total stink bomb, awful coaching, couldnt have played worse, lost by 38, quit as the game went on, only everyone forgot about them within eight hours); McCarthy (coached the NFC title game with both hands wrapped around his own neck); all the Packers who screwed that game up (Morgan Burnetts slide, Dom Capers going into the prevent on third-and-19 and generally rolling over during those last three TD drives, Brandon Bostick, Green Bays special teams coach for being blindsided by a fake field goal attempt when they were up 16 with almost 20 minutes to go); Roger Goodell; Roger Goodell a second time; and everyone who cleared Russell Wilson to come back after Clay Matthews destroyed him (more on this in a second). But McCarthy was THE biggest winner. We should have spent that whole week after the title games wondering if he had just presided over one of the three biggest chokes in NFL history (and how culpable he was). Instead, just Packers fans were doing that.\n\n\nBS: Before we answer that question, \n (\"That Game\") after the Vikings blew the NFC title game in January 2010:\nSo that answers our first question: That Packers loss cant be Level 1-worthy because there wasnt a tortured history in play. Theyve won a Super Bowl within the past 20 years \n the Super Bowl trophy is called the Lombardi Trophy. And yet, that unbelievable Packers collapse and San Antonios unbelievable collapse in Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals were waaaaaaay worse than Stomach Punch games -- those were guaranteed victories that flipped only because of a bizarre chain of events. Those collapses required multiple mistakes, multiple great plays by the other team, at least one bad break, at least one exceptionally lucky play, and at least one high degree-of-difficulty play. If anything in that chain changes -- even one thing -- then the original team still wins. Also, you knew during the unbelievable comeback that something HAUNTINGLY INSANE might be happening. That, too.\nSo I vote for a new Level 2: \"The Box.\" See, \n also featured bad coaching decisions; terrific execution by the seemingly losing team (Spacey); a chain of events that could have fallen apart had one thing gone differently; and, ultimately, a haunting defeat. A quick recap ...\nPitt and Freeman are delighted that they finally caught serial killer Spacey, only now theyre driving him to that undisclosed location in the middle of nowhere, and they know something is wrong, but they cant put their finger on it, and they get there, and theyre just waiting there, and its more and more nerve-wracking, and maybe they shouldnt have gone there in the first place, and then some car drives up to deliver a package, and everyone freaks out, only its just a package, but then they realize its more than a package, and now they cant shake the terrible feeling that theres something IN the package, only theyre afraid to open it, only Freeman cant resist opening it, and then Pitt starts screaming \"Whats in the box?\" while deep down knowing that theres something truly disturbing in the box. And everything leads to Pitt screaming ...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ddqR1zNXDE\nThats Level 2. The Box.\nBS: Instead, they had Mike McCarthy. Uh-oh, I feel a run of McCarthy emails coming on. You better hold on to something.\nBS: Yep, we had a two-way tie in this months \"Come Up With the Meanest Nickname Possible For Mike McCarthy Contest.\" I say youre both winners -- just call the game \"Scared Shitless in Seattle\" and nickname your coach Free Birthday Bingo Mike. Everyone wins. Buy each other \n and go celebrate.\n\n\nBS: I stopped pretending a long time ago. Heres Andy telling a story for Mike that definitely ends with the punch line, \"Come on, like I WASNT going to settle for a field goal there???\"\nBS: Somebody just won $200 on 45-to-1 odds that \n would be the only Denzel movie referenced in the 2015 Super Bag. Its like betting on the safety.\nBS: That easily could have been signed, \"Every Patriots Fan, Everywhere.\"\nBS: I just wish a controversial movie had come out over Christmas that had two characters repeatedly saying, \"Hate us cuz they aint us,\" that I could embed. Wait, what?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcvxhUjvTC0\nBS: First of all, thanks for leaving out \"deflating footballs.\" I really appreciate it. Second, Im predicting a goofy four-tight end alignment with Gronk, Tim Wright, Michael Hoomamamoomo (my Dads pronunciation for New Englands third-string tight end) and tackle-eligible Nate Solder on a third-and-1 play with no right tackle and two of those four guys ineligible and all hell breaking loose followed by Collinsworth nearly having an on-air orgasm when the play goes for 18 yards.\nBS: Come on! I mistakenly assumed that J-Love wasnt relevant enough anymore. Its been 10 years since \n to tell my wife that I thought Jennifer Love Hewitt was attractive and that I enjoyed her acting, and when I did, \"she reacted like George Brett in the Pine Tar Game.\" Its been three years since Ken in Brighton asked me who the anti-Hewitt was -- a.k.a. the female celebrity whom women will irrationally defend if you disparage her in any way. \n! Thats right, once upon a time, there was a likable Kardashian! Oh, and J-Love last headlined a show on the Lifetime Channel. Her decade-long run is over -- theres just no way she inspires the same cattiness anymore.\n(Thinking.)\nJust to be sure, lemme show \n to the Sports Gal and tell her that J-Love looks \"super-hot for a pregnant lady.\" (Hold on.) Yup, didnt faze her. Slight frown followed by, \"Whats she doing now?\"\nBy the way, I went to the Producers Guild Awards last weekend and realized that Jennifer Lawrence is the new anti-Hewitt (and probably has been for a while). She gave a speech introducing Lionsgate CEO John Feltheimer, winner of the Milestone Award, and was so funny/adorable/charming/endearing that, by the end of it, everyone in the room would have made out with her except for Sharon Stone (who looked like she was plotting ways to steal J-Laws hemoglobin and inject it right into her veins). Hey, speaking of things that can cause you to get divorced ...\nBS: Absolutely. Theyve been reaching out. And dont forget -- the NFL might expand to 14 playoff teams, which means six playoff games in 36 hours in Round 1. Theres a good chance that Goodell is trying to cause a national divorce epidemic to throw everyone off his decomposing commissioners scent. You cant blame him.\n\n\nBS: This might give Grantlands Bill Barnwell and Ben Lindbergh dueling heart attacks, and it might even cause both of Jonah Keris temples to explode, but I am typing it anyway: I believe that luck, as weird as this sounds, is a skill. Whenever I play golf with my buddy Ness, anytime he hooks or slices a drive, it bounces off a tree and lands in a favorable spot. We joke about it every time -- I always say that God feels bad because Ness has three young daughters who will torture him through their teens and then eventually make him pay for three weddings, so He ordered all of Nesss lousy drives to ricochet toward the fairway. We dont even make the joke anymore when it happens; we just say, \"Three daughters!\" But thats a skill. Its just part of his golf game. He has to get credit for it.\nSame thing for Wilson and Eli. They have exhibited the skill, repeatedly, to get super-lucky in big games. Its no different from Nesss drives bouncing toward the fairway or my father-in-law winning every time on cheap slot machines. (Also true.) I believe in regression to the mean, and I believe in luck evening out over time, and I believe in repeating myself to make sentences longer. Wilson scares me because of his legs, because he gets a little better when it matters, and because hes lucky. I dont like rooting against lucky people.\nBS: Youll have to wait until the end.\n\n\nBS: Check out this Vine and tell me Jason is wrong.\n[protected-iframe id=\"7df83fdb2a3c71b70dbf0721096368d0-60203239-57815212 info=\"https://vine.co/v/OjthvuhYgEW/embed/simple\" width=\"600 height=\"600 frameborder=\"0]\nAnd check out Seattles drives from that point on. First of all, on Wilsons next drive after that hit, Seattle ran the ball six straight times before the drive eventually ended in Wilsons awful end zone pick. We didnt see throwing/scrambling Wilson again for another two quarters -- almost two hours after that Matthews hit -- and then he started looking a little bit like Wilson again from the 10-minutes-left mark on. Put it this way: Theres just as much circumstantial evidence that the Seahawks hid Wilsons concussion (or Wilson hid it from them) as there is that Brady and/or Belichick knew those balls were deflated. SO THERE!\nBS: I swear on my new puppys life a second time that this happened -- as I was trying to \"honestly\" answer this question, the space bar jammed on my laptop and I had to pry it back up with a steak knife. I dont know what this means.\nBS: And thats another fun plot from Sundays game that hasnt gotten enough attention -- has there ever been a Super Bowl matchup with more unpopular teams? Just call it the Haterade Bowl. Sundays winning coach should have his players just \"pour\" an empty Gatorade bucket on him and say it was Haterade.\nBS: Absolutely. Even better, hes desperately hoping -- yet again -- that he can get through another press conference/how-is-this-guy-in-charge?/debacle/stammerfest without anyone asking questions like:\n\"Are you 100 percent sure that your officials measure the PSI of footballs before every game, or do they just touch them like theyre watermelons at a farmers market and say, That one seems fine?\"\n\"Why in 2015 are teams allowed to keep their own inspected footballs for two hours right before a game starts?\"\n\"Why do we allow teams to doctor their own footballs however they want? Do you realize no other professional sport would ever in a million years do this?\"\n\"Why did everyone blame the Patriots for those barely deflated footballs and nobody blamed your officials who touch the football after every play?\"\n\"Can you blink twice, ad-lib a sentence about the Oscars, then blink twice again just to prove to us that youre not being remote-controlled?\"\nBS: I tweeted this on Sunday night: \"the Philly fans flipped over the Roman Reigns bandwagon and set it on fire.\" But heres the crucial difference: McMahon HAD a remarkable run. This might be a slump and only a slump. Goodell has never, at any point, had any type of a run. Hes your Vegas buddy who keeps leaving the blackjack table to take out more money from the ATM -- only for eight solid years. Rogers \"worst commish\" title is more than safe.\nQuick \n story: The Simmons family threw 30 numbers in a hat, then took turns picking them for our first-ever \n pool.\n Everyone threw in 20 bucks, making it my sons first gambling experience. As we neared the end, my daughter had Roman Reigns and my son had everyone else. My wife was finished, and I didnt have anyone left, but no. 28 was my last number. So they count down to no. 28 ... and it ended up being Cesaro. My son started laughing like a maniac and screamed, \"Youre done! Thanks for the 20 bucks!\" Ive never been prouder. Gambling! I think hes hooked. Hes only 7 -- what could go wrong?\n\n\nBS: And then read \n. That Sharp Football Analysis article was debunked, redebunked and unbunked on every corner of the Internet. But lets keep forwarding it around. Im starting to get ornery.\nBS: Forget the article; you can do it in one paragraph. What actually happened: In 2006, the league sent out a memo that teams were no longer allowed to tape opposing coaches signals from the stands; the Patriots ignored the memo when they played the Jets in 2007; they got caught with someone taping from the stands; as a penalty, they lost a 2008 first-round pick and paid $750,000 in fines; and they handed over six other tapes to Goodell, who \n and handled the investigation in a typically confusing/bumbling/inexplicable way that became his trademark. \n. We thought about doing a 30 for 30 about it once; there wasnt even enough for a 30 for 30 Short. \"Spygate\" = fantastic name, boring scandal. Hence, the embellishments as time has passed.\nBS: \n The Internet would have eaten it up. The NFL should reprogram his hard drive and have him do that one of these times. By the way, I agree with a reader named Rob from Australia -- if the Patriots win on Sunday, Belichick has to say \"On to Disney World.\" He just has to.\nBS: To be fair, I dont HATE anyone. Its sports. But when I wrote \n my Big Three was Kobe, Manning and A-Rod. Those were three of the biggest sports-hate icons of the past 20 years, along with Bonds, Favre, Clemens, Tyson and post-dog-fight Mike Vick. Now theyre gone. All of them. I actually envy all the non-Boston fans who sports-hate Belichick and Brady so much -- those are the last two sports hate icons. The rest of us are stuck with the likes of Eli Manning, the Sedin Sisters and Corey Perry.\nQuick tangent: My 2015 sports-hate list is made up of 90 percent hockey players. Thats been one of my favorite things about owning L.A. Kings season tickets -- hockey players are so much more detestable in person than on TV. You can really feel the venom in the stands. I mean, I dont even sports-hate Corey Perry; I actually HATE Corey Perry. Heres a typical Perry play:\nBS: Congrats to Deadskins fans; you narrowly edged Knicks fans and Lakers fans in the mailbag race to send me the most variations of the \"How do we hire Ritas lawyers if she wins?\" jokes. Yet another huge honor for Daniel Snyder, the Corey Perry of NFL owners. Look out, Washington fans, hes coming again!\nBS: CHEATERS!\nBS: CHEATERS! CHEATERS!!!!!!!!\nBS: Where can I preorder the 2015 Super Bowl video, \n Do they have to win the game first? Can I preorder it anyway? Hold on, I drank too much water today -- I have to go deflate 12 footballs in my bathroom. The readers are taking over. Ill be right back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBS: Im back. Thanks to the readers for holding the fort. And for the record, a three-hour telecast of Goodell getting creamed in a dunk tank would be the 109th-greatest dunk-tank moment of all time, behind the 108 different times this happened with a 70s or 80s babe on \n when they were looking for any excuse to get them wet in a bathing suit. Here, watch. These three minutes single-handedly put me into puberty.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSt4wzTUVdw\nBS: Thanks, Brian. I love Seattle as well. Its my favorite non-Boston city. I would live there if it didnt rain so much and if the Sonics were still there. Thanks for the email, and f- - -  the Seahawks.\nBS: The official sponsor of the National Football League ... literally and figuratively!\nBS: Thats not a song about cheating! Hold on, Im looking this up.\n(Uh-oh.)\n(Oh no! Wait, maybe this is a misunderstanding.)\n(Why? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY? Only one thing can salvage this karmically -- if Katy Perry covers \"Your Love\" during the halftime show. Name your price, Katy. Well start a Kickstarter fund right now.)\n\n\nBS: Another great question. Weve already had seasons tainted by bounties, domestic violence, blackouts, impostor refs, PEDs ... I mean, whats left? Just gambling and concussions, right? So what about a blown-out version of Wilsons may-or-may-not-have-had-a-concussion subplot from two weeks ago? Heres how it would go:\nLate in the fourth quarter of a classic nail-biter, either Wilson or Brady gets crushed on a hit and is clearly concussed, somehow passes the sideline concussion test, comes back to win the game in dramatic fashion, wins the Super Bowl MVP, then tells the Disney cameras, \"Im going to Dez Bryants house!\" They rush him to the hospital for \"precautionary measures.\" Two days later, we find out that, yes, he suffered a severe concussion. That leads to the usual Goodell crisis formula -- a rash suspension, a protest, an independent investigator, and then the rash suspension getting eventually overturned in a report released seven minutes before the Final Four starts. Send this man another $44 million.\nBS: With apologies to everyone who compared Belichick to Worm from \n (\"Im always gonna look for that edge\") or Belichick to Darth Vader (with Brady as Luke), Im partial to all references from \n here if only because Belichick is the Michael Corleone of NFL coaches, Pete Carroll was once Fredo (\n), and Belichicks second press conference definitely set up a post-exoneration press conference with his consigliere, Robert Duvall (played by Jonathan Kraft), screaming, \"THIS COMMISSIONER OWES MY COACH AN APOLOGY!\"\nAnd yet, its not the BEST possible movie clip. Here, look.\nBS: Come on, like I wasnt going to hire an animator to see what a Belichick/Montana speech might look like? Please, if you like the NFL, you like \n, and you dont mind NSFW language, press \"play\" on this embedded link.\nhttp://youtu.be/4Jr4PGeKtQ8\nBS: Its the same as the over/under for Seahawks who will fail a PED test after the game: 0.5. That reminds me, here are my favorite Super Bowl props:\n Tom Brady over 25 or more completions (+120)\n\n\n Tim Wright over 0.5 receiving yards (+115)\n\n\n Michael Hoomanawanui over 6.5 receiving yards (+130)\n Lump these three together. Why? The Seahawks come out with their chests puffed in their 4-3, steer clear of any gimmicks, dare you to throw deep and dare you to beat them with 15-play drives. Well, Brady loves long drives. He loves picking teams apart. Watch for various multiple-TE packages that spread Gronk wide, watch for those not-illegal-receiver formations that fooled Baltimore, and watch Seattles secretly-not-that-good pass rush giving Brady too much time. This feels like a \"Brady throws 40 times to nine different receivers\" game to me.\n You heard me right -- I am \n that my 37-year-old QB might throw 40-plus times against an excellent defense in the biggest game of the season. No, Im not drunk.\n Luke Willson over 35.5 receiving yards (-130)\n\n\n Marshawn Lynch over 21.5 receiving yards (-110)\n Both numbers are 15 to 20 yards too low. Also, you know how the Patriots have gotten killed by the wheel route all season? Well, go to the 43-second mark of \n from the Packers comeback. The Seahawks LOVE running that play with Lynch. Im starting to get nervous.\n Gronk will have over 22.5 more receiving yards than Doug Baldwin (-115)\n\n\n Al Michaels will call a Gronk TD \"A Gronking to Remember\" (+750)\n Only because Belichick booked Baldwin a one-bedroom suite on Revis Island and put a \"DO NOT DISTURB\" sign on his door. I may or may not have made up the second prop.\n Brady for Super Bowl MVP (+180)\n\n\n Lynch will grab his crotch after a TD (+250)\n Same for both. The Pats arent beating Seattle unless Brady has a great game, and Lynch isnt scoring a TD without grabbing his crotch. So if you believe that either event is happening (Pats victory or Lynch TD), why not grab the extra odds? And wouldnt you want to yell the words, \"YES! CROTCH GRAB! I WIN!\"? By the way, I did NOT make up the second prop.\nBS: Im right there with you. Hold on, one more email.\nBS: Yep, these are my readers. Lets get to my big Super Bowl pick ...\n\nAre we SURE Seattles defense is that good? The Seahawks arent playing at home. Their fantastic secondary suddenly has Earl Thomas playing with a dislocated shoulder and Richard Sherman playing with a mystery elbow injury. They slowly rebuilt their badass defensive reputation after back-to-back losses to Tony Romo (Week 6) and Austin Davis (Week 7) by beating Cam Newton, Derek Carr and Eli Manning, losing to Alex Smith, then beating Drew Stanton, Colin Kaepernick (twice), Mark Sanchez, Ryan Lindley, Shaun Hill, Newton again, then a one-legged Aaron Rodgers. Their pass rush is pretty good, but not great; its certainly not on the level of the 2007/2011 Giants. Even when they were at home, when Manning and Rodgers needed to drive on them for game-tying drives this season, they did it pretty easily.\nI dont know if this years Patriots could beat last years Seahawks ... but they can beat this years Seahawks. They wont make dumb mistakes like Carolina did. They wont wuss out on fourth-and-1 and fourth-and-goal like Green Bay did. They wont let Wilsons legs beat them. Theyll win the special teams battle against Seattles secretly flimsy special teams. They wont allow Seattles pass rush to knock Brady around. They should be able to rip off long drives, protect the ball and keep Wilson and Lynch off the field ... IF Brady plays well.\nWhich brings me to my three biggest concerns: New Englands own shaky pass rush (perfect for Wilson to buy some time and do Wilson things), Lynch activating Beast Mode (just a tough matchup for the Pats in every respect), and Brady not totally being Brady (very possible). See, theres a not-quite-good-enough Brady performance always lurking; we saw it during the second Giants Super Bowl, and we saw it during that terrific Packers-Pats game in November. Its what happens when your QB hits his late thirties -- when youre asking him to throw 35-40 times a game to win, you know youre getting a couple of ground balls, one wobbler, one awful pick and one wide-open deep pass thats 2 yards too long. Thats what Seattle is banking on. Pressure over time. They dont care if hes Tom Brady. They care that hes 37 years old. And that he doesnt throw no-hitters, or even four-hitters, anymore.\nAnd thats all fine. But here are the stakes for Sunday: If the Patriots win and Brady plays well, hes the greatest QB of all time AND he shoves the last two weeks in everyones face. Normally, Super Bowls dont hinge on one player or one question because too many people affect a typical football game. But this game actually does hinge on the question, \"How great is Tom Brady at age 37?\"\nMy answer: not totally great, but great enough. I could totally see him standing on that platform on Sunday, four months after that disaster in Kansas City, fighting off tears and holding that Super Bowl MVP trophy. I could see Goodell quickly handing that Lombardi to Kraft and fading into the background before the boos get any worse. I could see Belichick answering Bob Costass first question by saying, \"Were on to next season\" and giving that little shit-eating Belichick smirk. And I could see everything getting undermined the following day by some \"new\" revelation to Deflategate that gets debunked three days later. Thats my favorite football team, the New England Patriots, the perfect champion for a truly effed-up season.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/running-diary-super-bowl-xlix-new-england-patriots-seattle-seahawks/", "blog_text": "Super Bowl XLIX was like the last episode of \n (and \n). I will always remember watching it, I will always be dumbfounded by the ending and I needed 48 hours to figure out what I \n happened. What was Bill Belichick doing? What was Seattle doing? What was EVERYONE doing? This isnt a retro diary, its a retro retro diary. Its time to relive, regurgitate, recelebrate and re-heart-attack the final 12 minutes of Super Bowl XLIX.\nA quick recap: With five minutes left in the third quarter, Seattle took a 10-point lead after Doug Baldwins touchdown catch featured the following subplots: the umpire/evil WWE referee picked off Darrelle Revis in the end zone, allowing Baldwin to escape from Revis Island for the only time all night; Seattle covered the \"same team will score three times in a row\" prop; Baldwin earned a 15-yard penalty for stealing Adam Carollas poop-the-football touchdown celebration gimmick (conspicuously omitted from NBCs live NBC telecast!); Richard Sherman mocked the Patriots by yelling \"Twenty-four!\" to the sideline cameras twice (seemingly, once for Revis and once for Seattles score); and every Pats fan briefly thought \n before rallying and shifting into \"COME ON, WE HAVE TOM FAWKIN BRADY!\" mode.\nNew Englands next drive: three-and-out.\n(Uh-oh.)\nAnd just when it looked like Seattle was pulling away, it left two game-clinching drives on the table. The first one fell apart after Jermaine Kearse dropped a gorgeous lob pass on New Englands 20, followed by Golden Tate screaming somewhere in Michigan, \"I dont care if that was a fairly tough catch, I would have caught that!\" The Pats went three-and-out after LeGarrette Blount summoned the Super Bowl ghosts of Laurence Maroney and BenJarvus Green-Ellis by getting stuffed two yards behind the line on third-and-1. The Seahawks responded with an even uglier three-and-out.\nThis left the Patriots with 12 minutes to score twice while knowing ...\n* They just went interception-punt-punt on their first three second-half possessions, and now they were trying to become the first team to win the Super Bowl after being down by eight or more in the fourth quarter.\n* They were 12 minutes away from being tortured by eternally annoying story lines like \"No Super Bowl wins since Spygate,\" \"Cant win when the QB throws normally inflated footballs,\" \"Would have gone 1-5 in the Super Bowl if two plays went differently\" and even just \"CHEATERS!\"\n* If Brady were to rally back from 10 down, he would clinch GOAT status and foil Seattles chance for back-to-back titles (a semi-impossibility in the salary-cap era). If he were to fall short, it would mean three straight Super Bowl losses and a winter-spring-summer of \"Maybe its time to change the offense so were not asking a 37-year-old quarterback to string together impeccable 13-play drives for four straight quarters on big stages because we can never run the ball when it matters and we havent had a deep threat since Randy Moss left\" conversations. Forget about the \"On to Cincinnati\" joke. We would have been \"On to a new offense.\"\nOn a personal note, this was the first Belichick-Brady Super Bowl I missed in person. Unexpected family obligations made up 90 percent of the reason why I stayed. The other 10 percent: I didnt want to go back to Glendale.\nNo! NO! Actually, I didnt want to go back. I didnt want to return to the place that reminds me of my dads \n, the Pat OBrien-Brady handshake, the Helmet Catch, Bradys third-down Hail Mary that went 80 yards in the air and \n, the 19-0 season going up in smoke and giddy New York fans reacting like they were just rescued from being trapped in a well. My God. That city, and that stadium, will always be the Scene of the Crime. At least for me. I have never witnessed a more devastating Boston loss in person.\nSo I stayed in California. And with 12 minutes to play, I wasnt exactly regretting it. Time for the retro diary. Were shifting to present tense for as much as possible.\n After Brady got sacked on first down and threw a four-yard out on second down, the reeling Pats are facing an uber-crucial third-and-14 on New Englands 28. Does the normally superb NBC crew use this specific moment to bring up Deflategate, question Bradys integrity and show Roger Goodell sitting glumly in his suite? Of course it does! Heres how it sounds.\nCris Collinsworth: \"I said, Tom, look me in the eye ... \"\n(Look me in the eye? What are you, his ninth grade principal? Didnt you already tell us this story in the pregame show? And why are you bringing this up right before the biggest third down of my season?)\nCollinsworth: \" ... and tell me you couldnt have possibly said anything to a ball boy, an assistant coach, somebody in the organization to lead them to believe that you wanted air let out of the football.\"\n(Hold on, were on the edge of our seats. I dont even care that my entire football season is on the line with THE CURRENT FN PLAY. What did Brady say? Did he confess? I really hope he confessed, because I cant think of another reason youre bringing this up right now.)\nCollinsworth: \"And he said, Absolutely not. He could not have been more emphatic.\"\n(Great. Great news. Also, if this were about Peyton Manning, Collinsworth would have thrown in, \"And I wasnt even a little surprised, because someday, were going to use Peyton Mannings hemoglobin to cure cancer.\")\nAs the word \"emphatic\" hangs in the air, Brady steps up in the pocket and drills a fastball to Julian Edelman for a 21-yard first down that (a) saves the 2014 season, and (b) may have concussed Edelman. See, Kam Chancellor annihilated him with what seemed to be a helmet-to-helmet hit ... except NBC never showed us the right replay even though it had 367 cameras there. The AP later reported that \n and \"cleared to return.\" \n The NFL is hilarious.\n A delayed screen to Shane Vereen for nine yards is followed by a senseless late-hit penalty by Earl Thomas for another 15. The Seahawks defense has clearly gone into \"Game Settings\" and tried to turn the penalties off.\n Brady misses on a deep ball to Brandon LaFell (an unabashed \"Lets see how much Tharold Simon sucks\"\n pass), followed by a 2-yard Vereen run that sets up another big third down. I say the words, \"Just dont take a sack here.\" Worst-case scenario: sack, 48-yard Stephen Gostkowski shank. But Brady steps up in the pocket AGAIN and finds a wide-open Edelman over the middle for 21 yards. Unfortunately, Edelman thinks his name is \"Julius\" right now, but still ... first-and-goal, Patriots!\n With Edelman slow to get up, Al Michaels reminds us that Edelman is being \"bothered by a hip.\" Or a concussion. Its one or the other. Just never forget: Michaels was the first announcer to save words on injury descriptions by only saying the body part itself. Had he been announcing the last scene of the \"Red Wedding,\" he would have said that Catelyn Stark was \"out with a throat.\" Seven catches and 97 yards for Edelman, by the way.\n Edelman runs the fake-inside-slant-pivot-outside-curl play (or as its unofficially known, \"The Welker\"), beats Simon by two yards ... and Brady fires the football 275 mph and nearly decapitates him. Incomplete. There are vague flashbacks to Brady missing a wide-open Welker in Super Bowl XLVI -- just because they were two frisky, possibly concussed white guys who were wide-open and got overthrown, but still. \"Thats as open as you will ever get down at the goal line,\" Collinsworth says. Ugh.\n Fighting off more Welker/Super Bowl XLVI flashbacks. If we settle for a field goal here ...\nOff a halfhearted play-action fake, Brady finds Danny Amendola over the middle ... TOUCHDOWN! (Fellow Pats fan Jay Jaroch pointed this out: Amendola caught 10 balls for 129 yards and three touchdowns in the Baltimore and Seattle nail-biters. Together that adds up to \n in 2007, right?) Its a nine-play season-saver for Brady that is punctuated by Collinsworth yelping, \"Woooo! This game is turning into something\" and Michaels alluding to the pick em point spread. Anyone who parlayed \"Brady will throw over 2.5 passing touchdowns to break Joe Montanas record for career Super Bowl touchdowns\" with \"Al Michaels will make a gambling reference\" is high-fiving.\nNew score: Seattle 24, New England 21, Times I Texted My Dad Just To Make Sure He Wasnt Keeled Over: Seven.\n Wilson throws to a seemingly wide-open Dontelle Lockette off a nice play-action fake, only Lockette falls down and cant grab it. The replay shows that Malcolm \"Future Dave Roberts 2.0\" Butler tripped and then slyly tripped up Lockette with his right hand ... NO CALL! Were finally even for end zone official Earl Hebner running that pick play on Revis. (By the way, Im making up fake first names for these anonymous Seattle receivers all column. Like youd heard of any of them before Sunday. You didnt even blink when I typed \"Dontelle Lockette,\" admit it.)\n Lynch rambles for 5 before getting tackled by 18 Patriots.\nConfession: Lynch won me over during Super Bowl week when he infuriated the MAWGM (Middle-Aged White Guy Media) by stonewalling them at media day, then double-downing on the F.U. with an unexpectedly gregarious performance as Gronks costar in \ns epic \n bit. Whats better than an athlete effectively admitting, \"Im actually entertaining and hilarious when I want to be, but I refuse to waste it on sports media assholes\"?\n You have my full support, Marshawn. Come to the Pats this spring! The only quote youll ever have to say before and after games is \"On to (the next opponent).\" And well give you and Gronk a reality show. You cant lose. Name your price.\n Coming off an NBC/Collinsworth \"Russell Wilson is so great!\" montage that conveniently omits Wilson going 9-for-24 for 94 yards with zero touchdowns and four picks with only three minutes to go in the NFC title game, Wilson misses a wide-open Lynch for what should have been a 20-yard completion.\nImportant tangent: 2014 opponents killed the Patriots with the wheel route to running backs coming out of the backfield. In \n, I even picked \"Lynch over 21.5 receiving yards\" as one of my prop picks knowing Seattle was saving that play. Watching live with multiple Pats fans at my friend Jimmys house, we all agreed during the fourth quarter, \"They havent run the wheel route yet, you know its coming.\" Well, it came. Lynch came out of the backfield, pretended to run a slant, faked out Jamie Collins, turned it upfield ... and for whatever reason, froze before continuing the route (and Wilson missed him).\n\"He didnt really believe (Wilson) was gonna throw it to him, I guess,\" Collinsworth says. BECAUSE RUSSELL WILSON WOULD NEVER MAKE A MISTAKE! AND HED NEVER LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND LIE!!!!!\n Punt, fair catch by Edelman on New Englands 36. What a lucky three-and-out: The Pats got away with pass interference and survived their biggest Kryptonite play. Theyre 64 yards from taking the lead (glass half-full), 30 yards from field goal range (glass half-empty) and minutes from the worst turnover of Bradys career (glass totally empty).\nThis is one of my favorite Super Bowl wrinkles: Every two or three years, theres that one real-time moment where you realize, \n. This was one of those times. You could feel it.\n Brady throws over the middle to Vereen ... one-handed catch! \"It is Shane Vereen time in this game,\" Collinsworth says. Im glad he brings this up.\n Laurence Maroney -- 14 carries, 36 yards, 1 TD\n\n\n BenJarvus Green-Ellis -- 10 carries, 44 yards, 0 TD\n\n\n LeGarrette Blount -- 14 carries, 40 yards, 0 TD\nJust 38 carries for 120 rushing yards total in the last three Super Bowls? But wait ...\n Kevin Faulk -- 7 catches, 52 yards, 0 TD\n\n\n Danny Woodhead -- 4 catches, 42 yards, 1 TD\n\n\n Shane Vereen -- 11 catches, 64 yards, 0 TD\nThe new-wave Patriots treat swing passes, screens and quick slants for that Faulk/Woodhead/Vereen target as pseudo-runs. They dont care how their backs get yards, just that theyre getting yards. Check this out:\n 29 touches, 117 yards, 0 TD, 5 first downs\n\n\n 27 touches, 154 yards, 1 TD, 4 first downs\n(The lesson, as always: This is why Belichick doesnt spend money on running backs. I am not holding out hope for the Marshawn Lynch era.)\n Vereen for five more yards. First down. By the way, say good-bye to the Seahawks pass rush -- they were already thin before Cliff Avrils game-ending concussion, which allowed the Pats to neutralize a \n shortly after he became the favorite in everyones \"Which Player From Super Bowl XLIX Is Most Likely To Fail A Postgame PED Test?\" office pool.\n Edelman turns a short pass into a nine-yard gain by doing that crazy-low-to-the-ground-hop-forward thing. We dont spend enough time figuring out how Belichick cloned Wes Welker with Edelman. Forget about Deflategate -- thats going to be the scandal that brings down the Belichick Patriots.\n Swing pass to Vereen for another first down ... but wait! They call an illegal downfield block on Amendola even though (a) Seattle is setting more picks than Wes Unseld, and (b) again, SEATTLE SCORED BECAUSE THE UMPIRE RAN A PICK PLAY. Whatever.\n Seattle sends five guys ... and an under-pressure Brady burns them with a Gronking To Remember over the middle for 20 huge yards. First down, field goal range. (Brady picked on the kind-of-secretly-overrated Chancellor for much of this drive, by the way.) Thats followed by a Vereen swing pass for no gain that Michaels describes verbatim like this ...\n\"Brady will sling it out, Vereen, and theres Richard Sherman, whose girlfriend is pregnant, shes due in about two weeks, but shes here. Hes ready to go to the hospital in uniform if need be.\"\nHearing that reminds me of one of my favorite Jeff Cesario bits -- about former NBC announcer Curt Gowdys penchant to throw obscure facts into the biggest moments of his broadcasts \n so I make a mental note to find it on YouTube after the game. Of course, I find it because EVERYTHING is on YouTube.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBMIf2n4lyk&t=29m56s\n Gronk spreads out wide and dusts Seattle linebacker K.J. Wright for another first down. It remains unclear why the Pats didnt just spread Gronk wide on every play this season just hoping that the other team would defend him with a linebacker or strong safety. He would have finished with 476 catches for 5,245 yards and 56 TDs.\n Shotgun, stacked line of scrimmage, Seattles linebackers on their heels and playing five yards off the line ... and Vereen slices through the line for seven yards. For the record -- this will be remembered as one of the most important Patriots drives of all time (and a signature moment for Bradys career), but this was one of their BEST drives ever, too. They worked Seattles much-ballyhooed defense like a speed bag for five solid minutes. Vintage Brady. I have been watching football for 40 years -- for me, I would have wanted only Brady or Montana in this specific spot. Nobody else.\n Seattle switches to zone, so Brady finds an uncovered LaFell for seven yards. Thats followed by the play clock running down, a seemingly unimportant timeout by Brady (hold this thought), and Blounts first-down run for two yards. In the moment, I would have bet anything on one of two play calls:\n* Gronk spread wide, quick slant over the middle, tough catch in traffic while fending off borderline pass interference that never gets called, because Gronk gets officiated like NBA refs used to treat Shaq in the early 2000s. (Im in full homer mode right now. Sorry.)\n* Edelman dekes Simon with the same fake-the-slant-and-spin-outside move that already worked for Edelmans previous almost-TD.\n(Well, they didnt spread Gronk out, so ... )\n Touchdown, Edelman!\n Patriots 28, Seahawks 24.\nBradys last two drives: 13-for-15, 124 yards, 2 TDs. Brady on the second drive: 8-for-8. For the second time in his life, he can grab QB GOAT status if his defense can just hold for two minutes in Glendale, Arizona. This isnt weird at all.\nQuick tangent on Edelman (nine catches, 109 yards, one TD): Last winter, Edelman passed up more lucrative free-agent offers to stay with New England, and only because he was smart enough to realize, \"My quarterback is Tom Freaking Brady.\" He could have spent the past season in Jacksonville risking his body and brain to catch a never-ending slew of Blake Bortles wobblers over the middle; we never would have thought about him again. (See: Decker, Eric.) Instead, hes a Super Bowl hero. A possibly groggy Super Bowl hero, but a Super Bowl hero.\n, but after I ran into him with mutual friends during that shit-or-get-off-the-pot point of his free agency, Edelman raved about Brady for 10 solid minutes like John Travolta talking about David Miscavige. I came away thinking, \n. Well done, Edelman. Hes no longer just a good receiver with a name that makes him sound like the villain in a 1980s James Spader movie. Hes a Super Bowl champ, a perfect example of the whole \"grass isnt always greener\" philosophy. And now, he gets to make up that lost money with his own cooking show. GIVE THIS MAN A SHOW! Screw it ... Im offering him a Grantland show! Name your price, Julian.\n New England 28, Seattle 24. My emotions in this exact order ...\n1. Holy shit!!!!\n\n2. TOM FAWKIN BRADY!!!!!!!!!!\n\n3. Wait, I kinda wish we had scored AFTER the two-minute warning.\n\n4. Does this game have to be in Glendale, Arizona?\n\n5. How much time was left when Eli got the ball in Super Bowl XLII?\n\n6. (Looking around.) Who has cigarettes?\n Collinsworth tells a story about Wilson remembering the time he held up his first Lombardi Trophy, immediately wanted one more and then decided he wanted six (like Michael Jordan). Did you ask him to look you in the eye before he told you that story, Cris? Holy mackerel, we have a lot of healing to do.\n Kickoff ... touchback. Now Seattle has three timeouts AND the two-minute warning. No squib kick there? Wait, am I questioning Belichick? My bad.\n Seattle smartly spreads Lynch wide (oh God), where he pretends to run a slant (oh no), turns it outside (oh Jesus) and beats Jamie Collins down the sideline for 31 what-the-hell-just-happened yards. Why 2014 opponents didnt figure out different ways to send their backs deep against New Englands linebackers over and over again will always be the third-biggest mystery of the 2014 Patriots season, narrowly trailing Deflategate and the fact that they spent their first-round pick on a guy with no ACLs. I was never NOT terrified of that situation. Two-minute warning.\n(The dirty secret of the Belichick era: For whatever reason, his Pats kept giving up backbreaking drives at the end of Super Bowls. The 2002 Rams, the 2003 Panthers, the 2007 and 2011 Giants, now the 2015 Hawks ... basically, every team they played except the one with an out-of-shape Donovan McNabb running the first-ever 10-minute drill.)\n Wilson to Kearse deep over the middle ... broken up perfectly by Malcolm \"Im About to Be Famous But You Dont Realize It Yet\" Butler. Thats followed by Wilson taking too much time and being forced to burn a timeout. HUGE MISTAKE. Collinsworth kills time by making a good point: Seattle has been practicing two-minute drills all season, only without no-name turned hero receiver Dave Matthews\n involved (four big catches, 109 yards, one TD, working in a Foot Locker earlier this season). Is that a disadvantage here? Maybe.\nSpeaking of disadvantages, every Pats fan is secretly bracing for (a) the wheel route to Lynch, or (b) the try-to-get-a-Brandon Browner-pass-interference play call that Seattle hasnt uncorked from its pull-big-plays-out-of-our-asses wine bottle yet. Or as its more commonly known, The Eli Playbook. One of those plays is coming.\n And there it is! Broken up by Browner in the end zone! No flags! Wilson had time,\n couldnt find anyone, then realized, \n and heaved it to Matthews. Incomplete, no flags. (Exhale.) Thats one of the things I will remember about the 2014 season: Anytime an opponent threw deep and I realized Browner was involved, dread lingered somewhere between \"Uh-oh, I cant find my wallet\" and \"Uh-oh, my child is being dangled off a balcony.\"\n Wilson hits Frank Lockette for a crucial first down thanks to a rattled Logan Ryan playing six yards off the line of scrimmage and running backward at the snap. Poor Ryan lost his confidence in the first half,\n inspired a round of bitter \"We should take Ryan out and put in Ras-I Dowling\" jokes all across New England and it only got worse from there. Was Logan Ryan the poor mans Tharold Simon of Super Bowl XLIX, or was Tharold Simon the poor mans Logan Ryan? Its hard to say.\n Collinsworth breaks down the whole Ryan debacle as we see a close-up of Ryan defending Antonio Lockette, then adds, \"Lockettes a guy with brilliant speed, so Ryan has to be careful.\" And as those words are ripping the oxygen from my lungs ...\n A quick recap of my emotions during this play ...\n1. Oh, no, hes throwing deep.\n\n2. Good, thats not Ryan or Browner.\n\n3. What a play by Butler!\n\n4. Why did it seem like Kearse caught it even though Michaels just said it got broken up?\n\n5. Why did Butler hop up and desperately push Kearse out of bounds?\n\n6. Why does Michaels seem so excited all of a sudden?\n\n7. Wait ...\n\n8. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ddqR1zNXDE\nAnd then everything went numb.\nFor like three minutes.\nCouldnt react. Couldnt feel anything.\nPeople were yelling in disbelief all around me ... I couldnt move. They showed the replay. The football bounced off Kearses hands, Ryans hands and back up into the air. As Kearse fell on his back and tried to find the ball, safety Duron Harmon jumped \n Naturally, the football plopped back down off Kearses left leg and then his right leg, buying him time to tip it with his right hand, then it fell into his hands as he remained on his back. Also, he gave birth to a nine-pound baby just because everything else wasnt unbelievable enough.\nIts like God decided, \"What could be worse than the Helmet Catch? What if I created a catch under the exact same circumstances, with the exact same stakes, in the exact same building, with the exact same defense out there, only this time, the football hits seven body parts before its caught? Would that clinch Tyree 2.0 status? Should I throw in a couple more body parts, or are we good with seven?\"\nAnd if that werent enough ...\nAfter two gut-wrenching replays sandwiched the deja vu shot of a stunned Brady looking on in disbelief, Michaels smartly remembered, \"This was where Tyree had the helmet catch -- this is the scene of the crime\" as NBC rolled off the Helmet Catch replay.\nI mean, what are the odds? Seriously?\nWould you believe a \n sequel in which Ben Afflecks character gets framed for the murder of his second wife, Amazing Emily, who turns out to be just as crazy in all the same ways as Amazing Amy? Youd never buy this in a million years, right? Well, the Lap Dance Catch happened.\n The Lap Dance Catch somehow trumped the Helmet Catch. It was even MORE ridiculous. My god. Why do we follow sports? Why do we do this to ourselves?\nAnd no, I dont know what would have happened to me if I had gone to the game. I cant even imagine. Thank god I didnt go to the game.\n(Or so I thought at the time ... )\n(And as I was thinking all of these things, I didnt even realize that Seattle had blown its second timeout. Or that Belichick was standing there for three idle minutes playing out all the possible scenarios in his head.)\n Beast Mode rambles left and heads for the end zone (Ill admit it: I absolutely wanted him to score) before Patrick Chung (shoestring grab to slow him down) and Donta Hightower (got there just in time) bring him down at the 1.\n Timeout, Patriots. Also, Im still dead inside. This is what Hannibal Lecter felt like after Murder Victim No. 12, when he was running out of ways to stay interested and started telling himself things like, \"Maybe I could EAT the victims.\" I am dead inside. I cant feel anything.\n Wait, theyre not calling timeout.\n Call timeout.\n CALL TIMEOUT!!!!!!!\n I AM NO LONGER DEAD INSIDE!\n WHAT IS HAPPENING?\n I AM HAVING A STROKE!\n OK, lets shift into present-day mode. We know what happened now, but it made no sense at the time (and took me nearly 24 hours to understand). \n. A long, fascinating email from a poker player helped. Talking to two of my Patriots sources helped. Watching the game tape over and over again definitely helped.\nHeres what we know: Seattle had already wasted two timeouts, so it had to pass on second or third down. If it ran Lynch on second down and didnt score, it would have had to burn the third timeout and pass on third down, too.\n Only he didnt. Remember that seemingly unimportant timeout that Brady wasted? That made it impossible for New England to stop the clock three times. This was now a poker game. What do you do when you know you have the lousier hand? You bluff.\nI believe he hatched this plan during Seattles second timeout: \n He liked having those 50-50 pass odds on second down. He wanted the game to speed up. He wanted confusion and chaos. He wanted that in-game pressure to tilt Seattles way. If youve ever been at the Super Bowl for a big win-or-go-home drive inside the 10, its more chaotic than youd ever imagine. I remember being there when the 2012 Niners drove for a first-and-goal against the Ravens, seemed like they were scoring, failed on first down and then, suddenly, the energy in the building changed. Everything got tense. You could feel it. Like being on a speedboat thats going a little too fast.\nBelichick made an emergency plan, felt that in-stadium energy shifting after Lynchs first-down run, then thought to himself, \n Remember, Butler told reporters afterward that theyd specifically practiced to defend THIS PASS PLAY. And remember ...\n Goal-line stand, Pats win or lose.\n Timeout, New England. The Seahawks get to regroup, talk it over and think of their perfect play. If they score on second down, Brady has to dink-and-dunk for 55 yards in less than 50 seconds, against the leagues best secondary, with one timeout and no deep threats. If they dont score (and Belichick uses his last timeout), but they score on third down, now Bradys probably-doomed dink-and-dunk routine is happening in less than 45 seconds with NO timeouts. (And Gostkowski needs to nail his field goal. And overtime needs to go the right way ...)\nDont forget -- Belichick created the defensive plan that \n. He helped Bill Parcells drag Vinny Testaverde to a freaking AFC Championship Game. He went 5-11 in his first Pats season, and from that point on, he has gone 170-54 in the regular season and 21-8 in the playoffs (including Sunday). He has the most playoff wins ever. Hes one of two head coaches to win four Super Bowls. He has coached a record six Super Bowl teams. He has won 11 of the last 12 AFC East titles. Hes the only coach to ever finish 16-0 in the regular season. Hes the only active member of the 200-win club (only seven people in the club, by the way), the only active coach with more than 170 wins, and one of four coaches who won 100 more games than they lost. The last time Belichick finished below .500, Bill Clinton was president.\nPardon my French, but Im going out on a limb and saying it wasnt a fucking accident that Belichick never called timeout. He said to himself, \n He redirected the pressure to Seattles side and hoped theyd implode. Well ...\n Theres still confusion on Seattles side. Lynch is on the right and Wilson tells him to shift to the left. So he does. Seattle is about to run a slant pass out of a three-receiver set against an eight-man front and three cornerbacks ... in other words, its the right defense for this specific situation. Belichick knows it. Pete Carroll doesnt realize it. Leading to ...\n \"Pass is ... INTERCEPTED AT THE GOAL LINE BY MALCOLM BUTLER! UNREAL!!!!\"\nMy scattered thoughts ...\n1. I actually think the Butler pick was bigger than the Roberts steal. Its the single biggest either/or play in the history of Boston sports ... and probably NFL history, too. If Butler picks it off, the Patriots win the Super Bowl. If hes a split-second late, or he doesnt hold on to the ball, they probably lose the Super Bowl. Theres no in-between. Its either the greatest or the second-greatest interception in Super Bowl history, depending on how you feel about James Harrisons 100-yard scamper. You could make a legitimate case that its the most important defensive play in NFL history. Other than that, no big deal.\n2. Theres a short list of unlikely Boston heroes who helped win titles (Butler, Gerald Henderson, Dave Roberts, Glenn McDonald) and a not-quite-as-short list of unforgettable plays in big moments (Hendus homer, Fisks homer, Hendersons steal, Birds steal, Orrs Cup winner, Vinatieris 48-yarder in Super Bowl XXXVI, Ortizs game winners in Games 4 and 5 of the 2004 ALCS, etc., etc.). Butler lives on both lists for the rest of eternity. Hes football Dave Roberts crossed with Gerald Henderson, but with a little Hendu thrown in, only if you super-sized all three plays.\n3. As for the fan side of this whole thing, heres a great email from Vermont reader Ben Finer: \"The last three plays [of Seattles last drive] were like the Aaron Boone home run in 2003 followed by the 0-3 comeback back in 2004, but without the 12 months in between.\" Exactly.\n4. The Seahawks took too much heat for the final play call; statistically, its \n to throw a pick than fumble from the 1 (according to 2014 data, anyway). You also had Carrolls lingering \n (the generic fourth-and-2 call to LenDale White that got stuffed and cost USC the game), as well as their balls-to-the-wall attitude in general (the same mentality that got the Seahawks that end-of-the-first-half touchdown and the fake field goal touchdown two weeks ago). Thats not a switch you shut off in big moments. You are who you are.\nTheir biggest mistake (in my opinion) was not rolling Wilson out for a safer run/throw/throw-it-away play. Throwing a quick slant to a below-average receiver (Lockette) carried too much unnecessary risk. This wasnt Randall Cobb or Edelman or Dez Bryant. What if the ball bounced off Lockettes hands or shoulder pads and went popping up in the air? What if the ball got tipped? This wasnt a stupid call as much as an arrogant one. Then again, look at this ...\nIf youre Wilson, dont you happily throw that ball every time? Cant we just say that Butler made an all-time unbelievable play? If Revis made it, wouldnt it have been treated differently?\n5. Put it this way: At least 12 Patriots fans/friends sent me some variation of the \"It took 17 years, but Pete Carroll finally came through for us!\" joke. About two weeks from now, after I am finished digesting every other angle of this game, I will be ready to savor the Coach Fredo-related subplots from this game. Super Bowl XLIX was like a Paul Thomas Anderson movie; you need to watch it 12 times before you can process everything.\n6. An email from last weeks Super Bag ...\n(I mean ... )\n Do you take the safety here? No way. You have Brady sneak it forward, even as Ampipe Highs goal-line fumble in \n loomed over everything. But before he took the snap, Brady and Belichick had one more masterstroke up their sleeve ... the hard count! Did Bennett bite? Of course he did! Game, set, match. Only one play was left: Seattle started an \n brawl on Bradys next kneel, with only one Seahawk getting thrown out even though Gronk fended them off by punching multiple attackers and killing someone with a trident. Stay classy, Seattle.\n Your Super Bowl XLIX champions ... the New England Patriots. They were dead in Week 4. They looked dead again in Week 19. They were dead and buried at the 59-minute mark of Week 21. Every time, they rallied back. And, look, you dont want to hear someone who just rooted for four Super Bowl champs saying anything other than, \"That was awesome,\" even if this title meant just as much to Patriots fans as the 2014 title meant to Spurs fans. But hear me out.\nWhen youve been rooting for the same people for 15 years, at some point the stakes become greater. You want that last exclamation-point title. (Just ask Spurs fans.) You want to feel like you rooted for a dynasty, or something close to it, instead of just \"a team that won a couple of times.\" You want to say that you rooted for the best coach ever and the best quarterback ever, and you want to be constantly amazed that they showed up to save your sad-sack franchise at the exact same time. Patriots fans took Deflategate personally, and with reason -- it was a shoddily reported story that never added up. Belichick and Robert Kraft remained defiant that the team did nothing wrong; the fans followed suit. Its always fun to root for a champ, but when it becomes \"us against them,\" it resonates in a totally different way.\nThat exclamation-point title happened only after a legitimately astounding sequence: Kearses stomach-punch catch; Belichick bucking conventional wisdom and mind-fing Carroll; Seattle sticking with a pass play against the wrong defense, looking disorganized and plowing ahead anyway; then Butler jumping the route like he was being fast-forwarded, crushing the receiver, holding on to a bullet pass AND lurching forward to avoid the safety. This sideline camera view of the pick was incredible (I hope YouTube keeps it up) ...\nCheck out Butler walking up to Browner and warning him whats coming.\nCheck out Browner foiling the pick play by jumping right into Kearse and holding him so he doesnt pick Butler.\nCheck out Butler sprinting at warp speed to the exact spot where the ball was heading. \n Think about that for a second.\nAnd so an undrafted rookie made the biggest defensive play in Super Bowl history. But how much credit does Belichick get? People bring up his savvy game plans against the 1990 Bills and 2001 Rams, or the ballsy Brady-over-Bledsoe decision, or 11 wins without Brady in 2008, or a Super Bowl win with Troy Brown playing nickelback, or even the controversial fourth-down call against Indy that didnt work and became The Call That Built The Sloan Conference. They bring up Spygate, his disheveled outfits, his salty press conferences, even his bad cop/good cop relationship with the Krafts. They bring up how he \n and coldly dumping key players one year too soon instead of one year too late. They bring up his \nlike ability to relentlessly look forward without ever dwelling on the past.\nHes a coaching machine. Theres a human being lurking under there, someone whom his friends swear by, but Belichick never allows the public to see it. He uses Patriots fans the same way we use him and the Krafts use him. We just want to win. We dont care that America doesnt like him. We stay out of his way. Just dont quit on us. Dont retire. Dont announce out of the blue, \"Im good, Im done, see you later.\" You cant even compare him to other football coaches. Who was Belichicks competition these last 15 years? Andy Reid? Tony Dungy? Bill Cowher? Tom Coughlin? Please.\nAnd yet, Belichick never had that one signature moment. We never caught it when it happened in this Seahawks game -- thats how good this one was. We thought he fell asleep. We thought he froze. \nYou know what really happened? Belichick trusted seven months of practice and two weeks of scouting, and he trusted the fact that hed already prepared a 24-year-old undrafted rookie to react perfectly, historically and remarkably if that slant was coming. Hell never get credit \n After all, how could a coach behave THAT differently from every other coach in that exact same spot?\nThe answer: Hes not like any other coach. Of anyone -- seriously, of anyone -- hes the one guy who would stand there and say, \"You know what? I think Pete Carroll might screw this up. Im not doing anything even if I dont have the best hand. Im gonna let him raise the pot. CHECK.\" The rest was history. Whenever youre arguing about the greatest NFL coaches of all time, just remember the final minute of Super Bowl XLIX. The man finally gave us his version of Jordans game winner in the 98 Finals. And like everything else that happened with the great Bill Belichick over the years, nobody totally believed him."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/ready-for-prime-time-the-giddy-brilliant-and-ok-somewhat-bloated-snl-40/", "blog_text": "If you think of \n as a massive dress rehearsal that inadvertently became the live show, the whole night makes more sense. For one of the few times in his life, Lorne Michaels couldnat cut anything. How do you cut that clumsy aCaliforniansa sketch and tell Taylor Swift and Bradley Cooper, aActually, weare NOT going to need youa? How do you tell Paul McCartney, aSorry, it looks like weare not going to need that post-BeatlesA songa? The 40th-anniversary show was never intended to be anything other than imperfect. You know, like the show itself.\nI thought it was incredible. The whole thing.\nFirst of all, no other television show could do \n. No other program could whip out 40 years of history and dozens of iconic moments while entertaining us in real time AND staying true to the format of the franchise itself. No other TV show could say, aIn the process of celebrating ourselves, we realized that we needed to go as long as the freaking Oscars.a No other franchise could pull off its own personal aIn Memoriama segment and make it work. No other show could heave out so many celebrities that, by the time Jack Nicholson wandered out there in his potbellied, gravel-voiced haze to read from a few cue cards, we had lost the capacity to feel starstruck by anyone. By the two-hour mark, only a dead celebrity would have gotten a reaction from me. \nSecond, we have seen pieces of shows like this before, but never \nA the pieces together in one place, and never as a brazen attempt to piece a bigger puzzle together. In 1996, the NBA celebrated its 50thA anniversary by naming the leagueas 50 greatest players and reuniting 47 of them, but itas not like those legends played a round of full-court games. In music, weall see benefit concerts or Hall of Fame shows from time to time aA always disjointed, always scattered in terms of quality aA but thereas never a unifying theme other than a bunch of famous bands and musicians taking turns trying to play music well.\n combined those two mind-sets while feeling like the greatest high school reunion ever aA a reunion that, as Steve Martin cleverly joked during the monologue, was like the reunion of aa high school thatas almost all white.a 30 Rock was the high school. Lorne was the principal that everyone had. And everyone came back for him. This played out like the climactic band scene in \n, only if Mr. Holland had become an influential multimillionaire who won a slew of Grammys and evolved into one of musicas biggest power brokers. Just seeing everyone who passed through the show aA cast members, writers, hosts, whomever aA became its own viewing experience. The sketches, montages and taped pieces were a collective bonus.\nThird, even if we didnat need to be reminded that \n belongs to New York City more than to anyone else, last nightas show captured it with the finest montage of the night. There were five other montages: 40 yearsA in fiveA minutes, political humor, sports humor, the best of \"Weekend Update\" and the best of short films. Strangely, they never ran a fake-ads montage (instead running actual ads for Colon Blow and Mom Jeans aA which made little sense) or a musical-acts-over-the-years montage (I would have preferred that to sports, if only because one of \nas enduring victories has beenA its uncanny ability to catch so many musicians at the \nA moment when their careers were exploding). But the New York City montage made up for any other misfire. Only three TV shows turned the city into an actual character to this degree: \n, \n and \n. Cast members came and went for 40A years, but New York City was always there. That particular montage will endure.\nFourth, I canat remember anyone embracing the idea of career mortality better than theA \n show did. This was like watching the aNBA at 50a legends actually playing in the All-Star Game with Harden, Westbrook and LeBron. Yeah, they looked old as hell. Yeah, they were better 20 or 30 or 40 years ago. \n. Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake launched the show with a musical number that incorporated many of the showas famous catchphrases and one-liners; even if it didnat totally work, you left it thinking, \nMaybe 25 minutes later, a bloated Dan Aykroyd ripped off his own Bass-o-Matic sketch from 40 years ago aA same lines, same beats, even the same Laraine Newman cameo aA and it wasnat nearly as good as the \n. \n. Heas not the same guy anymore. He knewA it. We knewA it. Lorne knewA it. Nobody cared. Once upon a time, Aykroyd pitched that fake ad at a meeting and everyone else in the room glanced at each other, the envy pouring out of them, before they finally realized, \nA And now he was running it back. Because it was \n, and because he could, and because why not?\nThatas what made last night special aA for me, anyway. The respect flowed both ways. Newer stars and in-their-prime stars trying to impress the legends who once inspired them a| and at the same time, the legends trying to prove they still belonged on the same stage. Just eras colliding, constantly, for 210 minutes. It wasnat an accident that only four musicians were chosen to perform: Miley Cyrus and Kanye West (representing the aright nowa), and Paul Simon and Paul McCartney (representing the aback thena). Miley never sounded better. Kanye did Kanye stuff. As for McCartney and Simon, they came out knowing they werenat as good as they were 15 years ago, much less 25 years ago and 35 years ago, only it didnat matter. They werenat competing with Kanye and Miley. They knew better. They just wanted to be involved.\nAnd going a step further aA Lorne \nA them to be involved. No musician meant more to \n than Simon. His Garfunkel reunion carried the second show ever filmed. He kept coming back again and again aA Lorneas best friend in the world, old reliable, as we watched him age with the show. After 9/11 happened, Simon opened that seasonas first \nA show by singing aThe Boxera with selected New York City policemen and firemen grimly watching from the stage. Itas the greatest moment in the history of the show, and the most meaningful one, too. Simon had to be featured prominently last night.\n[protected-iframe id=\"912a552859e8421af552a7a0f8e074a6-60203239-64855669 info=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/cold-open-9-11-tribute-070000854.html?format=embed\" width=\"640 height=\"360 frameborder=\"0 scrolling=\"no\"]\nSo did McCartney, not just our most famous living musician but the one who nearly validated the first season aA when Lorne offered a nominal sum to the Beatles to play on one of the shows, and McCartney and Lennon (watching together) nearly hopped in a car to call his bluff. Two decades later, after the show morphed into an institution and McCartney had broken that 30 Rock seal, he appeared on the best episode ever of aThe Chris Farley Show.a \nA McCartney belongs to the show just like Simon does. They came back because they had to come back.\nAnd again, the show wasnat perfect. You could have sliced 30 minutes without losing anything. They bungled what should have been a killer \"Weekend Update\" with Tina Fey, Amy Poehler and an enjoyably feisty Jane Curtin by ditching traditional one-liners for celebrity cameos (Emma Stone as Roseanne Roseannadanna?). They wasted multiple stars on an excruciatingly long \"Californians\" sketch that featured uncomfortable cameos from Laraine Newman and Taylor Swift. Ellen Cleghorneas turn on Seinfeldas Q&A bit bombed horribly, to the degree that Iam sure the Internetas Shame Police will come after them today. They never really unleashed Will Ferrell or Kristen Wiig; they marginalized Chevy Chase and Billy Crystal; they snubbed Dick Ebersolas considerable contributions (no surprise because of the checkered history between Lorne and Ebersol, but still); and they pretty much ignored the Eddie Murphy era (when Lorne wasnat there, of course), save for a far-too-brief Joe Piscopo cameo and an aborted Eddie segment ...\n... that Iad describe like this:\nIf you wanted to nitpick \n to smithereens, you absolutely could. For 40A years and counting, our expectations for the show were always too high aA why should anything have changed last night? Superb one-liners were sprinkled throughout the night. Martin Short joking, aIf this roof collapsed right now, it would be the least of NBCas problems.a Keith Richards introducing McCartney by saying, aIn the early 60s, a band came out of England and it changed the world. But enough about the Rolling Stones. Ladies and gentlemen, Paul McCartney.\" Seinfeld predictably quipping, aI just found out that one of the first cast members in 1975 was Brian Williamsa (as the live audience squirmed). Sarah Palin asking, aHow much do you think Lorne would pay me to run in 2016?a Tina Fey saying, aAlso joining us tonight, one of the showas original producers: cocaine.a\nI loved seeing Myers and Carvey throwing on their Wayne and Garth wigs like it was an Old-Timers Game, then breaking out dueling Lorne impressions aA not only because they were both excellent, but because it was a subtle nod to the Hollywood rumor that Myers stole Carveyas Lorne impression for his Dr. Evil character.\nI loved Baldwin as Tony Bennett and Norm as Burt Reynolds in the surprisingly solid \"Celebrity Jeopardy\" sketch. I loved seeing Piscopoas Sinatra impression again, especially because Piscopo gained 30-plus years since the last one (and seemed more like old Sinatra than ever before). I loved Louis C.K. ribbing the sketches for being too long, I loved Martin Shortas phenomenal Robert Blake joke, and I loved the intentionally conceited back-and-forth with Seinfeld and Larry David. I loved the running joke about Jon Lovitz being dead (which paid off beautifully at \n), as well as Bill Murray calling back the \"Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead\" joke from Season 1.\nI loved five things over everything else a|\n[protected-iframe id=\"d87676b1f6f87110127556ae7d2887a3-60203239-64855669 info=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/dont-look-back-anger-000000945.html?format=embed\" width=\"640 height=\"360 frameborder=\"0 scrolling=\"no\"]\nBut thatas the thing aA the show \nA old. And it has been counted out a bunch of times, only it keeps coming back. Buried in those 210 swollen minutes were Wayne and Garth ridiculing the aSaturday Night Deada headline that first became a meta story line in Season 6 and never really went away. You know why? Because everyone keeps looking for reasons to get rid of a show thatas never leaving.\nSee, somewhere along the line, \n became theA buddy who makes you say, aI love him, but I wish he wouldnat do (fill in 20 different things).a Itas the show that cares far too much about the culture of celebrity, about the sound of a studio audience reacting to the mere sightA of a famous person with urgent applause. It repeats sketches too much and never takes enough chances. Itas funny and frustrating and predictable and inventive and generic. Itas last night. And if you think I am deleting it from my DVR anytime soon, youare crazy."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/2015-nba-trade-value-part-2-the-temple-of-doom/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nba-trade-value-sneak-peek-no-10-kyrie-irving/", "blog_text": "\nFor Grantlands Trade Value TV special that ran on ESPN on February 8, I ranked Kyrie 26th overall and sent Cleveland fans into a rancorous frenzy. You would have thought I mistakenly said the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was in Cincinnati or something. You couldnt blame them for being salty. They had just watched the semi-floundering Cavs play .500 ball through the first 40 games as they inadvertently filmed their own 30 for 30 documentary. \n Their chemistry looked almost as shaky as the \n cast. LeBron didnt look quite like LeBron. \n. And David Blatt looked like he was headed for a 20-year coaching career in the Patriot League or the NESCAC.\nIn January, everything started to flip: Cleveland made two shake-it-up trades, came together defensively and ripped off a 12-game winning streak that included Kyries 55-point game against Portland. Cavs fans started feeling themselves a little. \nMy defense: I didnt feel right about rewarding a shooting guard trapped in a point guards body, someone ill equipped to execute the traditional \"make teammates better and take over when it matters\" recipe. I call those players \"0-guards.\" In some cases (a.k.a. Russell Westbrook), theyre so good that it doesnt matter. In other cases (Tyreke Evans, Steve Francis), it does matter. Kyries five-year, $90 million extension wasnt helping his cause, nor was the fact that his NBA teams had never succeeded for even four straight weeks. And also, I freaking hate Cleveland. I really do. (Just kidding.)\nBut I couldnt shake the fear that I had screwed up. I spent the next two weeks watching Cleveland more closely, ultimately bumping Kyries ranking before Part 2 of the written column was posted on February 25. LeBrons miraculous return to form (thanks to two weeks of R&R in Miami)\n had overshadowed a more compelling subplot: Finally, we saw all the ways Kyrie could affect a winning team. Ridiculous first step. Excellent shooting. Semi-freakociousness on fast breaks. A world-class ability to finish in traffic from any and every angle. Its all there. When you project him as a Wealthy Mans Tony Parker, Kyries basketball ceiling makes more sense: Hes a ridiculously efficient scorer who needs another creator (or a fluidly brilliant offensive system) to get everyone else involved.\nCould LeBron be that creator for him? No question. Its already happening. Even if Kyrie will never have the \n in his head (see Part 2), it doesnt matter if hes playing with the right guys. I was dead wrong about Kyries potential. But hey -- at least I got to the right place with it. Just took awhile.\nWhich brings me to Tangent No. 1 ...\nWhen Jalen Rose and I taped \n last month, we were killing time during one of the commercial breaks and I asked Kobe if he had any \"new\" favorite players. You know how great chefs always identify the other up-and-coming great chefs? Kobe fancies himself as that guy for the NBA alpha dog/badass/overcompetitive mfer corner. Knows it when he sees it. Even brags about being able to see it. He sniffed it out early with Westbrook (his favorite current star) in 2012 and -- to my surprise -- hes sniffing it with Kyrie now and said as much. He \n Kyrie. So that was a game changer for me. When Chef Kobe blessed Chef Kyrie, I knew it was time to wipe my Kyrie Opinion Hard Drive and start over.\nYou know who loved hearing Kobe praise Kyrie? Jalen. We had been arguing about Kyries potential for months. Now Jalen was smiling like someone had just served him a 7-pound lobster. And he added a crucial point: Jalen loved the fact that, even after LeBron had arrived, Kyrie never changed how he played and who he was. Didnt kowtow to LeBron. Didnt start doing an awkward John Stockton impersonation. Just kept attacking and getting buckets. For Jalen, \n That told him, unequivocally, that Kyrie was here to stay.\nWhich brings me to Tangent No. 2 ...\nOne of the coolest things about my job as it has evolved these past few years: getting access to so many memorable basketball players and basketball minds. Bill Walton and Larry Bird changed my too-harsh opinion of Kobes style; shit, the epilogue of my NBA book told the story about Walton and I arguing about \"The Secret\" or \"The Choice.\" I spent a year watching basketball games in a tiny conference room with Magic, and then a second year with Doug Collins. I talked shop with Kobe, off the record, a number of times. I spent a whole day with the great Bill Russell. I got to know Steve Nash and Steve Kerr. I spent multiple days with Charles Barkley. I spent three hours with Durant and Harden once. Ive picked the brains of dozens of famous NBA people on my podcast. Ive spent the past three years talking for hundreds and hundreds of hours with Jalen. I spent an afternoon in Vegas with Isiah Thomas that became the second chapter of my book. And Ive talked basketball with dozens of ex-players and ex-coaches who passed through the league -- everyone from Kiki Vandeweghe to Danny Ainge to Doc Rivers to Elgin Baylor to Jeff Van Gundy to Hubie Brown.\nOnce you learn how to discount personal agendas (they are endless), personal relationships (there are many), and just plain stubbornness (like Barkleys recent \n), fundamentally, you realize that those old-school lifers see things that you and I cant see. Hoop junkies bang out League Pass games, study those advanced metrics, read as much as possible, do everything we can to catch up. And many times, it works -- like when we thought Memphis might be better off without Rudy Gay while the old-school guys were astonished that Rudy got traded. So thats our trump card: just outworking the old-school lifers and learning as much as possible.\nTheir trump card: They can play or coach against someone like Westbrook or Kyrie -- even if its one time -- and pick out something in his DNA that we could never pick out. And again, you need to sift through the noise/agendas/biases/stubbornness to get there. That community doesnt trust advanced numbers; they dont care about PER, SportVU, shot charts or real plus-minus. And as the TNT guys recently showed after Kyle Korver made the All-Star team, its unclear whether many of them are willing to accept where basketball is going as a sport (pace and space, baby). That community wants basketball to be more black-and-white. Its just more familiar for them. Its what they grew up with.\nFor them, its about heading into basketball battle. Thats also why someone like Blake Griffin drives the old-school dudes crazy. He bitches at referees too much, bitches about getting hit too much, forgets to rebound, misses too many free throws and cares a little too much about making an impact off the court. They dont totally know if theyd want to go into basketball battle with him. They cant tell. Westbrook is the flip side -- theyd put up with his erratic shot selection because hes a warrior and a crazy competitor and a force of nature and everything else those guys love.\nAnd over the years, I have learned HOW to listen to that community. Just put it through its own little filter. For instance, Jalen enjoys Jamal Crawfords work for a variety of reasons, but mainly for those three times a month when Crawford activates heat-check mode and starts draining shots that nobody else in the NBA can make. The \n of that happening is why Jalen respects Crawford so much. Hes willing to jettison every negative in the Jamal package (poor defense, no rebounding, the occasional 5-for-18 stinker) and drifts toward those heat-check games and Crawfords unwavering confidence. And why? \n Just like I understand the degree of difficulty in, say, someone writing an especially good deadline column. \n I wanted Kyrie to be something that he could never be: basically, late-80s Isiah or Right Now Chris Paul, the point guard who spends 42 minutes making everyone better before taking over in the final six minutes. Jalen maintained that Kyrie wasnt that guy. I maintained that, until anyone proved they could win with him, I was out on him. We were in no-mans-land.\nAnd then ... the Cavs started winning ... and Chef Kobe blessed Chef Kyries overcompetitiveness/alpha/badass side ... and I happily waved the white flag. There IS something special here, as we witnessed during his epic destruction of San Antonio last night. I always thought Kevin Johnson had the best first step of any point guard Id ever seen; he had a downhill dribble, if that makes sense. Opponents were petrified of him. They would start backpedaling even before he made a move. Thats how the poor Spurs looked last night. They were just moving backward, almost like a defensive line getting pounded. Throw in his crazy finishes and his Curry-like 3s, and ... I mean, JESUS. Has anyone ever eviscerated the Duncan-Pop Spurs quite like that? He threw up 57 and it felt like 75.\nIf Kyrie keeps blossoming over these next two months, then it will start to feel like Miami in 2005 -- Shaqs first year, when Dwyane Wade made a massive in-season leap and suddenly they looked like Kobe-and-Shaq reincarnated. The biggest difference: 2015 LeBron is better than 2005 Shaq. The second-biggest difference: Kyrie is two months younger than Wade was in 2005. Sticking him 10th might not be high enough. Regardless, Im glad I came around on Kyrie.

Every NBA season yields positives for the noncontenders, no matter how hopeless or snakebitten or talent-deprived or poorly run your favorite franchise might have been. Just for kicks, weare throwing in a meaningful Dom Toretto quote to capture every noncontendersA state of mind. Letas take this column a quarter-mile at a time.\nI mean, what other Dom quote would you use for Knicks fans? Did their favorite team just spend $85 million last spring on a Derek Fisher mannequin and a 70-year-old tweeter who lives 3,000 miles away? (Yessir.) Are those the two people running the team? (Unfortunately, yes.) Have James Dolanas last 15 seasons yielded just five playoff appearances, one playoff series victory and 11 under-.500 seasons? (Um, yeah.) So why should Knicks fans be feeling good right now?\nTHEY HAVE A TOP-FIVE LOTTERY PICK!!!!\nItas incredible, and itas true: In the 21stA century, the Knicks have lost 49 games or more a whopping eight times, only theyve never picked in the top five of any draft. One problem: They kept dumping lottery picks or future lottery picks for established players like Antonio McDyess, Stephon Marbury, Eddy Curry and Carmelo Anthony. Another problem: They kept landing in the wrong top-10 spot a|A like no. 9 in 2003 (Mike Sweetney), no. 8 in 2005 (Channing Frye), no. 6 in 2008 (Danilo Gallinari), and, most painful of all, no. 8 in 2009 (Jordan Hill, taken one spot after Steph Curry). Thatas right, your answer to the question aWho is every Knicks fans favorite draft pick of the 21st century?a is \nThat all changes in May, when those embattled fans can enjoy their first genuine shot in 30A years at \n winning the lottery. Once thatas settled, they can enjoy multiple Chad Ford mock drafts, dozens of Okafor-or-Towns conversations, the inevitable aMudiay could own New York, should we just take him?a groundswell, some trade-up/trade-down scenarios, my inevitable aWhy wouldnat the Knicks trade Melo and completely blow this up?a podcast with Zach Lowe, and then the draft telecast itself. In July, they can pretend desirable free agents like Marc Gasol or LaMarcus Aldridge might consider signing with their faed-up franchise. At least things \n happen, right? Just remember, Knicks fans -- hope is a good thing, and no good thing ever dies. Not even if James Dolan is involved.\nIf USC asked me to teach a college course called aHow To Be An NBA GM,a Iad split up my 12 weeks of seminars into two-hour, subject-specific classes like aTake Everything Billy King Did, Then Do The Exact Opposite,a aJerry Westas Brilliant Summer of a96a and aThe Lessons of KAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHN!a Amazingly, aHow The Hell Did Flip Saunders Become One Of The NBAas Five Most Powerful Non-Owners?a wouldnat be my Flip-related class; Iad much rather break down his amazing Love-for-Wiggins trade -- maybe the only time an NBA franchise extracted more than 100 cents on the dollar for a perceived superstar.\nThe key to that trade: \n Usually, NBA teams want to finish reshaping their rosters in June and July; they fear uncertainty heading into the upcoming season. Flip never wanted Bostonas pupu platter offer (the no. 6 pick in 2014, a Brooklyn pick, expirings and non-All-Stars), even if most teams would have panic-settled for it. He thought Golden State might budge on Klay Thompson and David Lee; they never blinked. So he waited for a miracle a|A and then, suddenly, LeBron was thinking about a Cleveland return and the rest was history. Flip sold super-high on Love AND landed a superstar-in-waiting.\nSo what if he also spent nearly $100 million on Ricky Rubio, Kevin Martin and Chase Budinger, or that he inexplicably gave up a sweet Miami late-lottery pick for four months of Thad Young, or that he was the last person in Minnesota to realize that the 2014-15 T-Wolves should have been tanking all along? Flip can inhaleA the fumes of that Wiggins deal for years. Throw in this Juneas top-five pick and things are looking up in Minnesota! Weave almost reached the point when we can stop talking about the T-Wolves drafting two straight point guards directly in front of Stephen Curry. Almost.\nThey squandered the past three years because of the catastrophic Bynum trade and what Grantlandas Rafe Bartholomew dubbed the NBAas first Ponzi scheme. So whatas left? Letas see a|A Joel Embiid (missed his entire rookie season), Dario Saric (playing in Europe), Nerlens Noel (solid rookie year; looked extremely Theo Ratliffish), Robert Covington (an NBA rotation guy), a top-six lottery pick, Miamias 2015 pick (top-10 protected), a future Lakers pick (theyad need a miracle to get it next month, otherwise itas top-three protected in 2016 and 2017 and unprotected in 2018), a heavily protected OKC pick (expires after 2017; canat be a lottery pick), about 297 second-round picks and all kinds of cap space.\nKeep in mind: They tossed away three years, and counting, for everything in the previous paragraph. Itas no different fromA how a private equity firmA would gut a struggling company: strip it, lower the operating costs, profit short-term while figuring out what to do long-term, target cost-effective assets, then hope an improving market boosts the companyas value (which is exactly whats happening with Philly). Every move made sense on paper. If youare gonna stink in the NBA, you might as well S-T-I-N-K. If youare gonna lose 60-plus games for two straight years, you might as well cheap out. If Jrue Holiday and Michael Carter-Williams could never be one of the best two guys on a title team, you might as well flip them for three lottery picks and improve your odds to find a franchise guy a|A right?\nItas exceedingly logical. All of it. But if youare asking me to find positives, itas tough. The Sixers just became the first NBA team ever to say, unapologetically, aFor two straight years and possibly three, we arenat going to give a damnA about the product weare putting out a|A but by all means, please keep spending money on your seats.a Check out \n:A aTHIS STARTS NOWa in all caps. What starts now? Giving a shit? You just stole money from your fans for two straight years. Are your season-ticket holders getting future credit for the two years they just threw away?\nAnd what customer would put up with a business that operates like this? Imagine your parents purchasing season tickets for the opera if the Met said, aHey, this opera is gonna absolutely suck for the next three years, but starting in 2018 or 2019, we have a chance to be really good, so, um, can we have your credit card?a I shopped for season tickets on the 76ers website and found that, for the ludicrous price of more thanA $10,770, I could purchase two seasons in Row 13 of Section 113 (midcourt) for a team that just lost 120-plus games over the past two seasons and is probably headed for another 60 losses next season. No promise that itas a fixed price for the rest of the decade, no incentive plan, nothing.\nSTEALING YOUR MONEY FOR A THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR -- THIS STARTS NOW.\nSixers fans need luck with (a) the 2015 and 2016 lotteries, (b) the health of Embiid and Noel, (c) the Lakers pick, and (d) Saric. They need to know whetherA Embiid and Noel can actually play together. They have to hope that Sam Hinkie knows what heas doing a|A and considering that he just punted on MCW after a year and a half, who knows? They have to trust that their owners, at some point, are going to spend money. Itas the illusion of hope, personifed. \n Well, what if they donat? What if this really is a Ponzi scheme? However it works out, Philly fans will always remember it. Either your NBA team will be good in two to three years, or this will become one of the five best 30 for 30s ever. Thereas no third outcome. This starts now. Shut up and drink your Corona.\nOnly two destinations truly matter to NBA players: the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat (weall get to them). Thatas it. The Lakers will be fine.\nBonus positive no. 1: Kobeas Expiring Contract!\nBonus positive no. 2: Cap space!!!!!\nBonus positive no. 3: Hollywood! Bel-Air! Beverly Hills! Malibu! 75 degrees!

At least for now!\nBonus positive no. 5: Jordan Clarksonas emergence as This Yearas Second-Round Sleeper Headed For Good Things means the Lakers would be aphenomenally, almost historically stupida to overpay a severely declining Rajon Rondo this summer instead of atypically, par-for-the-course-lately stupid.a\nBonus positive no. 6: Hypothetical Vegas odds for aWill \n push her brother Jimmy out in the next 12 months?a have shifted to -500 (YES) and +400 (NO).\n(I repeat: The Lakers will be fine, even if it is nice to see their fans suffer for a couple of years. Welcome to the real NBA world, you guys.)\nNow \n something you never could have said about Jacque Vaughn. Shit, even an anonymous interim coach was able to light a late-season fire under Orlandoas likable young nucleus, a big reason why this is our best available NBA coaching job unless New Orleans opens up. Hereas what you have: five keepers (Elfrid Payton, Victor Oladipo, Aaron Gordon, Nik Vucevic and Top-Seven Lottery Pick TBD), a buttload of cap space and, of course, the Chance To Follow Jacque Vaughn.\nMy dream scenario: Orlando nails that coaching hire (Billy Donovan?), drafts Dukeas swingman/stud/beast Justise Winslow (my favorite 2015 lottery pick/team fit, hands down) and finds a free-agent rim protector. If those three things happen? The Magic could make a serious run at Milwaukee and Utah for 2016as Most Entertaining Young Team championship belt. God, I love the thought of Winslow on this team. That reminds me, is there a support group for sports fans who despised Duke for the past 20-plus years with a passion normally reserved for meter maids and traffic jams, only they \nA the Blue DevilsA collection of 2015 players and even found themselves rooting for them a couple of times?\nThe good news for Linder? He belatedly recovered from his head injuries and became Sacramentoas newest VP of personnel. Just kidding. I donat mind the nucleus here: Boogie Cousins (a borderline first-team All-NBA center who couldnat get it because his team stunk), Ben McLemore (blossomed in Year 2), Rudy Gay (shockingly solid this season), great and loyal fans, a top-eight lottery pick coming, Boogie a second time, and Boogie a third time. If you want to keep going, we have a great 30 for 30 coming about how Sacramento saved the Kings from going to Seattle. Oh, and the Maloofs are long gone. So itas not all bad. Even if the KingsA just endured the worst 13-year run of any NBA franchise.\nThe big question: When will the hilariously incompetent Vivek RanadivA(c) conquer New Owner Syndrome? When will he realize that you canat keep changing coaches and front-office executives every six months like youare replacing the oil in your car? When will he finally get the whole aYou hire the front-office guy first, then HE hires the coach because they have to work togethera sequence correct? Part of me hopes Vivek never figures it out; itas just funnier this way. Heas gone through four coaches and roughly 42 different front-office guys already. He just turned basketball decision-making powers over to the well-liked Vlade Divac -- someone who hadnat been involved in the NBA, in any capacity, for 10 solid years. Whoas next after Vlade doesnat work out? C-Webb? Bonzi Wells? The Christies? Lawrence Funderburke?\nStill, thereas a certain honor in rooting for the strangest, goofiest, most inexplicably incompetent franchise in basketball. When everything turns around, it makes the whole thing feel even sweeter. Trust me, Iam a Patriots fan. We stunk for the first 30-plus years of my life, then, all of aA sudden, we didnat. Keep your head up, Kings fans. And remember: At least you saved your team. Sure, you saved it and put it in the hands of someone who seems about as stable as Cookie from \n. But at least you saved your team.\nThereas a really fun Ty Lawson summer deal coming. Maybe a three-way that sendsA Lawson and a second-rounder to Utah, Jrue Holiday and Utahas 2015 lottery pick to Denver, and Rodney Hood and Trey Burke to New Orleans? Maybe Lawson for Darren Collison, Sauce Castillo and the rights to Sacramentoas top-eight pick? Or Lawson back to Charlotte for Kemba Walker, Charlotteas top-12 pick and one pick swap before 2020? Somethingas happening. Heas the best available point guard and the best change-of-scenery guy on the market right now. Someone will overpay for him.\nThe best thing the Nuggets haveA going for them other than that Lawson trade and 2015as lottery pick: They have Portlandas 2016 pick (lottery-protected) and a juicy future Memphis pick (protected 1-5 and 15-30 in 2016, top-five protected in 2017 and 2018, unprotected in 2019), and \n. Which raises an interesting dilemma.\n Deal Kenneth Faried for a pick (heas a classic buy-low candidate right now for any smart playoff team), deal the Gallinari and Wilson Chandler expirings before next Februaryas trade deadline, detonate their 10-minute car completely, then rebuild around their picks, buttloads of cap space and the future star of \n, Jusuf Nurkic. So the Nuggets could easily detonate their 10-minute car, but theyad be punting on that Knicks pick swap since theyad be just as bad (or worse).\n Turn Lawson into pieces that keep them competitive (the Holiday/Utah pick three-teamer is perfect), keep everyone else, make a run at a no. 7 seed and bank on that 2016 Knicks pick swap paying real dividends. Can you think of a better 21st-century asset than the sentence, aNext year, we get to swap first-round picks with the Knicksa? Itas neck-and-neck with Apple stock. I vote for Door B.\nHereas my favorite Nuggets stat, though:\nDenver from October 2007 through DecemberA 31, 2013: 316-190\nDenver from January 1, 2014, until now: 22-30 + 29-49\nWhat happened on January 1, 2014?

WellA be back on aProbably Just a Coincidence,a right after this.\nThe SVG plan: Dump Josh Smith (done); let someone else overpay Greg Monroe (imminent); pay Reggie Jackson (just donat overpay him, for godas sake); build around Andre Drummond, Jackson and a Top-10 Lottery Pick X (in motion); spend smartly this summer on a stretch 4 and one more 3-point shooter (doable) a|A I mean, there hasnat been a safer time to buy Pistons season tickets since Obama got elected.\nQuick Pistons tangent: I graduated from college in 1992, the same year Chuck Daly left the Pistons. Do you know how many head coaches theyave had since then? Fourteen! The complete list: Ron Rothstein (one year), Don Chaney (two years), Doug Collins (two and a half years), Alvin Gentry (two years), George Irvine (one-plus years), Rick Carlisle (two years), Dick Puller (one year), Larry Brown (two years), Flip Saunders (three years), Michael Curry (one year), John Kuester (two years), Lawrence Frank (two years), Mo Cheeks (50 games), John Loyer (interim: 32 games), Stan Van Gundy (one year).\nOne more Pistons tangent:A The Pistons joined the BAA/NBA in Fort Wayne while playing in 1948. TheyA hired someone named Carl Bennett as their first coach a|A and promptly fired him after going 0-6. Over the next 34 years, they employed 19 other head coaches, including Dave DeBusschere (as a player-coach), HerbA Brown and the one and only Dick Vitale (you read that correctly). Daly lasted for an entire decade (1983 through 1992); no other Pistons coach made it to the end of his fourth year. The Pistons have employed THIRTY-FIVE head coaches in all, compared to 27 for the Royals/Kings, 26 for the Knicks, 25 for the Lakers, 25 for the Warriors, 23 for the Bullets/Wizards and 17 for the Celtics. Just having a competent head coach is a huge, huge, huge victory for Pistons fans right now. (See, I told you this column would be positive!)\nWe might have to rename that 35-40 wins/borderline no. 8-spot/late-lottery area aCharlotteland.a The poor Horbobnetcats never intended to land there again, but thatas what happens after you whiff on Lance Stephenson and watch helplessly as Al Jefferson transforms into a 45-year-old man. Now they have three solid youngsters (Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Kemba Walker and Cody Zeller), a top-12 pick and little else. That would be fine except theyave had a whopping 15 first-rounders since 2004. FIFTEEN! Do you realize they picked second in 04; then fifth and 13th; third; eighth and 22nd; ninth and 20th; 12th; ninth and 19th; second; fourth; and ninth and 24th? Some sweet picks, right? Not if you took Brandan Wright, D.J. Augustin and Noah Vonleh one spot before Joakim Noah, Brook Lopez, and Elfrid Payton. Not if you were one spot away from Dwight Howard, LaMarcus Aldridge and Anthony Davis a|A and ended up with Emeka Okafor, Adam Morrison and Kidd-Gilchrist instead.\nThe Horbobnetcats havenat drafted a single All-Star since Baron Davis a|A in 1999. Since the first incarnation of the franchise launched in 1988, Charlotte missed the playoffs 16 of 25 times, won just four playoff series and never advanced past Round 2. So whatas positive about any of this? If you look at the NBAas 2014-15 attendance numbers, \nA at 17,227 fans per game -- just behind the Hawks and Grizzlies and ahead of the Pelicans and Suns. They even \n for next season! So thatas my positive for Charlotte: Itas a franchise blessed with loyal NBA fans who arenat ashamed to admit that they love mediocre basketball and poor decision-making.\nAssets: Dwyane Wade, Goran Dragic (probably), Chris Bosh, Hassan Whiteside on a minimum contract next season, South Beach, Riley and Spo, Stugotz and Mike Ryan, no Florida state income tax, South Beach a second time, Micky Arisonas yacht, the summer of 2016 (hold this thought).\nNegatives/Concerns: No first-rounders in 2015, 2017 (top-seven protected for two years, unprotected by 2019) or 2021; Boshas health; Wadeas age (34 next season); the possibility of Dragic double-crossing them and signing somewhere else (doubtful); the Le Batards; Hassan Whiteside unraveling (always in play); Hassan Whiteside turning into a pumpkin; Hassan Whiteside remembering that heas Hassan Whiteside.\nYou know how Knicks fans think their team will be fine because everyone always wants to play for a big market? Actually, Miami is the Eastern Conference team with a 20-year track record of landing marquee players -- Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway (mid-1990s), then Juwan Howard (1996 for about 10 seconds before the NBA voided that deal), then Eddie Jones and Brian Grant (2000), then Shaquille OaNeal (2004), then LeBron and Bosh (2010), then Dragic (2015). Again, \n Dudes will always want to play in Miami. For that and many other reasons, hereas your stealth Durant/2016 destination. Not Washington, not New York, not Los Angeles. Here. South Beach. Theyave done it before; theyall do it again. Miami will ALWAYS be fine. Thatas why Riley doesnat care about giving up those future first-rounders. Ride or die aA remember?\nThat quote made me think of the Pacers because they built such a potent family atmosphere there. What other franchise could lose Paul George (one of the NBAas best two-way players) and Lance (their second-best creator/defender); rebuild on the fly around Roy Hibbertas ghastly low-post game, Rodney Stuckeyas scoring and a bunch of C.J. Miles types; tell Luis Scola, aWeare gonna need you to ramp it up,a and then somehow stay lurking for a no. 8 seed with one week to go? NOBODY would have blamed them for throwing away the season. They refused. They believe their fans are family a|A and you donat turn your back on family, right? I thought the whole thing was awesome. Great job by the Pacers. Thatas what sports are all about.\nSo whatas left? Letas see a|A Larry Legend, Frank Vogel, a finally healthy Paul George, a lotteryA pick, the NBAas best building, the basketball capital of America, lots and lots of cap space and a proven track record of plucking bargain free agents. TheyreA fine. By the way, Iad like to officially elevate IndianapolisA to the no. 3 spot behind New Orleans and Miami on the aBest Host For Any Big American Sporting Eventa rankings, just ahead of Las Vegas and San Diego and \n.\nOne of my favorite Dom quotes goes to my favorite NBA renaissance: In less than 12 months, the Jazz found a real coach (Quin Snyder), stumbled into aA 22-year-old shot-blocker/rebounderA (the Stifle Tower), watched Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors blossom into legit pieces, created a genuine wrestling heel for their fans (\n, Utahas no. 1 enemy for the next 10 years)\n and struck oil with the best 18-year-old in the history of the NBA draft (Dante Exum). Fine, I made up the Exum part. But everything else happened. This summer, the Jazz need to either (a) sign an impact point guard, or (b) turn their top-12 pick, Burke, Hood and/or one of their future first-rounders from G-State and OKC into an impact point guard like Lawson (as described above). Whatever it takes. And yes, these guys would have stolen 2015as hypothetical \n and grabbed one of the no. 8 seeds.\nFine, Dom didnat say any of that. But after all the lottery picks Billy King has already givenA up, itas amazing that weare entering the heyday of lottery picks that Billy King is about to give up: a pick swap with Atlanta in 2015 (ouch) and Boston in 2017 (double ouch), as well as Boston getting Brooklynas unprotected picks in 2016 and 2018. Thatas four years of giveaways! Thatas an entire presidential term of genuine front-office incompetence! And we didnat even mention King winning last summeras power struggle withA Jason Kidd a|A who improbably turned into a good NBA coach in Milwaukee. The whole thing is amazing.\nSo, how can this be positive? Easy. The Nets are zigging when every other mediocre-to-lousy team is zagging. They canat tank because thereas no light at the end of the tanking tunnel. Not until 2019. Hence, theyare exploiting the Overpriced Competent Veteran Market with trades like aExpirings for Jarrett Jacka and aThe Artist Formerly Known as KGas Expiring Contract for Thaddeus Young.a This year, King willed a 30-win team to 39 or 40 wins. Next year, heall make two more Jack/Thad-type trades and maybe hell getA to 45 wins. Remember, thereas nobody else exploiting the Overpriced Competent Veteran Market. Itas just Billy. This might work. And with the rejuvenated Brook Lopez (assuming he stays) and two big expirings to trade (Joe Johnson in 2016, Deron Williams in 2017), there might actually be light at the end of Brooklynas tunnel. In Billy King we trust.\n(Important: I donat believe anything in the previous paragraph a|A I was just being nice.)\nDomas greatest quote goes to the greatest on-the-fly rebuilding job in recent NBA history: In less than 24 months, the Celtics turned two Hall of Famers, an All-Star point guard, the leagueas most expensive coach, Jeff Green and Jason Terry into Brooklynas unprotected 2016, 2017 and 2018 first-round picks; a 2015 Clippers first-rounder; a 2016 Dallas first-rounder (top-seven protected); a future protected Memphis first-rounder that becomes unprotected in 2021; Isaiah Thomas; Jae Crowder; Tyler Zeller; James Young; Gerald Wallaceas 2016 expiring; Phillyas second-rounders in 2015 and 2016; Minnesotaas second-rounders in 2016 and 2017; four other second-round picks; and last but not least, 2016 President-Elect Brad Stevens, a coach whoas so ridiculously good that the Celtics might grab a no. 7 seed during the same season in whichA they dealt their two best players and suited up 22 different players. Iave never felt better/prouder/happier/giddier about a team thatas six games below .500. What a season.\nSo, what happens going forward? Get a taste of the playoffs, show the rest of the NBA (and every free agent, as well as the agents of those free agents) that you happen to employ a coach whosA a freaking Jedi, keep mastering that pace-and-space/balls-to-the-wall style, and eventually, the Celts can land one or two difference-makers (either with their picks or with a package that comes for those picks). They are exceedingly well positioned -- they have the coach, the front office, the role players and the right style. They just need (gulp) the franchise player. Itas like watching someone serve an absolutely perfect four-course dinner that doesnat have an actual entrA(c)e yet. Well, that entrA(c)e is coming. One quarter-mile at a time, baby.\nHereas what the Bucks are showing us: Weare young, weare long, weare loaded with upside, weare a bitch to play, we can defend anyone, and weare headed for bigger and better things. I love everything about whatas happening here, and when Jabari Parker comes back, even better. They could absolutely topple Toronto in Round 1. Donat be shocked.\nAllow me a quick Giannis Antetokounmpo tangent: Heas been celebrated on the Internet for months if only because few things are more fun in 2015 than a freak NBA athlete with (a) a great nickname, (b) a ton of promise, and (c) a style that translates easily to Twitter, Vine and YouTube. Nobody knows where this is going. Heas only 20. But Iave seen enough aMilwaukee clears out for Giannis because heas feeling ita quarters to justify makingA the following comparison without feeling like a maniac:\nI attended a slew of Celtics games in the late 1990s because my father (who paid for our tickets) hated watching Rick Pitino and Antoine Walker and never wanted to go. I watched Young T-Mac on Toronto in person probably six or seven times. As a rookie, he looked totally lost. During Year 2 and the first half of Year 3, he looked like a safe bet to be the Robin to Vinceas Batman -- the second banana, the defensive stopper, the guy who could carry your offense when Batman was out, Vinceas own personal Pippen. Then, I remember seeing the Raptors after the 2000 All-Star break and T-Mac just lookingA \n You might remember this game because Vince drained a buzzer-beating 3 to win it:\nBut I remember leaving it thinking, \nA Suddenly he could handle the ball, shoot 3s, bounce off people in traffic, quick-jump over people for rebounds, defend anyone he wanted a|A I mean, you could just SEE it. You know whatas really crazy? Because the Internet lost its mind about two years ago, somehow thereas an edited YouTube clip of every good thing T-Mac did in this totally random game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuTcCNsPOYo\nHereas the point: T-Mac averaged only 15.4 points with 45-28-71 percent splits that season. His points-per-game for his next three years in Orlando: 26.8, 25.6, 32.1. Everyone knew we were headed for good things with T-Mac in Boston that night, but nobody knew we were headed for THAT. During Durantas rookie year in Seattle, the same freakish pieces were in place, only it seemed a little more conceivable that a mega-blossoming was coming because of his pedigree. With Giannis, itas a little more under-the-radar -- like it was with T-Mac in Year 2. Heas like a Durant/T-Mac scoring fetus. I can see it. How he bounces off people in traffic, how he gets his shot off from crazy angles, how he explodes to the rim, how he gets good shots off even when his opponent is playing perfect defense. Iam telling you, real stuff is happening here -- glimpses, pieces, flashes, but real stuff. In his second year, Giannis isnat even scoring 13 points a game. I bet that doubles within three years. I know they donat sell Bucks stock, but buy it anyway.\nThey turned last seasonas delightfully entertaining, unexpectedly promising and precociously young run-and-gun Suns team into this seasonas sullen, disjointed mess of a whatever-the-hell-happened-here. They turned Eric Bledsoe into a borderline max guy. They antagonized Goran Dragic by bringing in a third point guard, played him out of position for three months, took it personally when he bitched to the press, then panic-downgraded from Dragic (I voted him second-team All-NBA last season) to Brandon aYouare Gonna Have To Overpay Me So This Doesnat Look Like a Total Disastera Knight. They essentially flipped Dragic, Isaiah Thomas, Tyler Ennis, Miles Plumlee and that famously tasty Lakers pick (top-five protected in 2015, top-three protected in 2016 or 2017) for Knight and three non-lottery picks (Clevelandas 2016 first-rounder and Miamias 2017 and 2021 first-rounders).\nBuried under everything: Jeff Hornacekas mysterious free fall from a2014 Coach of the Year Candidatea to aPossessed by the Spirit of Vinny Del Negro.a No 2014-15 team blew more winnable games in dumber/unluckier/more inexplicable ways than the Suns. They were a 50-win team that somehow went .500. Then again, they STILL would have been a top-sixA seed in the East. Nail the lotteryA pick in June, sign Knight for a fair price and maybe theyare back in business. Stay positive, Suns fans. And definitely donat read this footnote.\nThey made the Finals in 2012.\nThey lost in Round 2 in 2013.\nThey lost in Round 3 in 2014.\nThey probably arenat making the playoffs in 2015.\nHarden plays for Houston.\nDurants contract expires in 2016.\nWestbrooks contract expires in 2017.\n(Um a| )\n(Wow, this is awkward.)\nWanna watch the scene from \nwhereA Dom saves Letty?\n(So, um a|A )\n(Letas just wrap the column up a|A )\n(Thanks for reading a|A )\n "}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/welcome-to-the-2015-sports-guy-mailbag-reunion-tour/", "blog_text": "But first, its a \n alert! On the heels of last nights \"Hardcore Playoff Preview\" with me, Jalen Rose and Zach Lowe ...\n... we have a second playoff special counting down the \"25 Most Intriguing People\" of 2015s postseason premiering tonight on ESPN at 7 ET. Were also running these \n shows as podcasts and throwing segments online (\n). And were producing four to six more shows during the playoffs, so if you want to contribute a mailbag question, send it to \n.\nHey, speaking of mailbags ...\nBS: First of all, words hurt. Second, Id like to welcome everyone to the 2015 Sports Guy Mailbag Reunion Tour! Im gonna try my hardest to write a Friday mailbag every single week during the 2015 NBA playoffs. Thats 10 weeks in all. If youve been reading me for this long, you know that Im notorious for making column promises that I can never totally keep. That happens because I always try to do too many things at once, and sometimes those things overlap and get me into trouble. (My version of events.) Or its because Im lazy and I dont care about my readers. (Everyone elses version of events.) Either way, my quest to go 10 for 10 on Friday mailbag columns will be at least 2 percent as exciting as LeBrons quest to bring Cleveland its first title in five decades.\nBS: You got laid twice even though you have two little kids? You need to be happier about this. Cheer up. Youre putting a damper on the 2015 Sports Guy Mailbag Reunion. As always, these are actual emails from actual readers.\n\n\nBS: There are a couple of other ways too. I spent four solid years working on a trial-and-error method of determining the MVP award, starting in 2006 (\n, which was and is the right pick), then 2007 (I jokingly picked the fans but \n; I stand by that pick, too), then 2008 (\n when I should have picked Kobe or CP3), and culminating in \n (which included an entire chapter correcting the NBAs biggest MVP award mistakes). I settled on four fool-proof questions for determining every MVP season. What better way to solve our most polarizing MVP race in years: Harden or Curry?\nNormally, youd say James Harden wins under this framework -- if you replaced him on that injury-ravaged Rockets team with, say, Arron Afflalo, Houston probably would win 35-38 games instead of 56. Thats our biggest swing in terms of wins and losses. Some people tried to debunk that point last week by pointing out that the Rockets were way better defensively than anyone realized (true), and that you cant just \n someone else for Harden. After all, they carefully built their entire team around his one-of-a-kind offensive game; its like trying to imagine \n without Liam Neeson. God forbid.\nCouldnt you say the same about the Warriors? Yeah, if you replaced Curry with Reggie Jackson, the Warriors might lose 15-20 more games while grabbing a no. 7 seed. Its an exceptionally coached team with enough depth to just \n David Lee whenever they feel like it. And their defense has been as good as their offense, which people always forget because its so damned fun to watch their offense. But Curry was the biggest reason that the 2015 Warriors were the seventh member of our .800/10 Club -- any team that finished with an .800-plus winning percentage and a plus-10 point differential -- which is relevant because the first six teams \n ESPNs Kevin Pelton already \n; throw in the remarkable spacing that Curry creates, the constant play-to-play fear that he brings out of defenses (and the pressure that puts on them), his devastating heat checks (which either pull the Warriors back into games or close them out), his crunch-time chops (significant), his once-in-a-generation playmaking (on the Maravich-Magic-Nash level at this point) and his underrated leadership (on a team defined by its chemistry and unselfishness, hes the best since Nash in those two departments), and something undeniably special happened here.\nHarden turned a .500 team into a 56-win team. Curry turned a no. 7 seed into one of the best regular-season teams ever, as well as an unforgettable League Pass team and the single best story of the 2014-15 season. So Curry wins this one.\nI love this question. It basically FORCES you to pick an alpha dog. As much as I want to pick Russell Westbrook, the thought of hinging my life on a night when Russ might lose his mind and start going 1-on-5 while maybe earning a 16th technical that the league cant even rescind because the loser of the hypothetical bet would be dead already ... I mean, that scares the bejesus out of me. The safest bet? LeBron James ... who seemed detached for the first two months of the season, slipped noticeably on defense (to be fair, he might have been on cruise control), and just wasnt as dominant, night after night after night, as Harden was. But if you build your team around Harden, youre screwed if the opposing GM immediately picks Hardens Kryptonite: Kawhi Leonard.\nYou know who the answer to this question might be? KAWHI LEONARD!!!! If I take Kawhi -- who proved after the All-Star break that hes the most destructive perimeter defender since Apex Scottie Pippen -- then I can lock down the other teams best offensive player and still grab an elite offensive guy with my second pick. The truth is, there were too many terrific players this season. Westbrook was \n; LeBron was 2015s hibernating alpha dog; Harden was 2015s alpha-dog-as-long-as-Kawhi-wasnt-around; Kawhi was 2015s alpha dog stopper; Anthony Davis was the alpha-dog-in-training; and Curry was the alpha dog on 2015s alpha dog. Its a cop-out, but theres no clear answer. (Important: In mid-June, we might feel differently.)\nApplies only if youre discussing the MVP race with a Cleveland fan who counters, \"Um, we were so dreadful that we won three of the last four lotteries, and then LeBron showed up and helped us overhaul our team, and suddenly were -230 favorites to win the East, and LeBron has looked like LEBRON for the past three months, and since weve already collectively agreed that hes the best basketball player since MJ and one of the best seven or eight players ever, um, why isnt he the MVP again? Isnt this Malone over MJ or Barkley over MJ all over again? Isnt everyone just bored of voting for LeBron? And doesnt GM LeBrons success help MVP LeBrons candidacy here?\"\nMy first counter: Cleveland started out 19-20 (in the East!!!!!) and it doubled as LeBrons worst stretch of basketball in 10 years ... and not just because he flew down to Miami for two weeks for an R&R trip as the season was going on. You cant submit a half-season campaign for the MVP award. Not even if you saved the city of Cleveland. My second counter: MJ lost the MVP in 93 and 97 \n. Thats the only reason.\n 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 5.5 apg, 2.8 spg, 50-35-84%, 29.7 PER, 17.2 WS, 57 wins\n\n\n 29.6 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 4.3 apg, 1.7 spg, 49-37-83%, 27.8 PER, 18.3 WS, 69 wins\n\n\n 30.8 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 5.1 apg, 2.3 spg, 50-36-83%, 28.7 PER. 16.1 WS per year\nImportant: The Bulls went 203-43 during the three regular seasons from 1996 through 1998, then 45-13 in the three postseasons (winning all three titles). They never lost three games in a row and played only one Game 7, even though they played 304 games in 31 months. JORDAN PLAYED IN 304 OF THOSE 304 GAMES. And during the second of those three seasons, even though wed already decided that MJ was the greatest basketball player ever, a majority of media members said to themselves, \n Its probably the dumbest thing that ever happened. Anyway, Jordans numbers never \n during that stretch. They dipped a little, but thats it. And his durability from 1996 through 1998 isnt just unassailable, its one of the greatest achievements in the history of the league. 304-for-304!!!! With a giant bulls-eye on his back the whole time! While facing the craziest amount of day-to-day scrutiny any NBA player has ever seen! MJ was the GOAT. Dont let anyone tell you differently.\nAnyway, heres LeBron ...\n 25.3 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 7.4 apg, 49-35-71%, 25.9 PER, .199 WS/48\n\n\n 28.0 ppg, 7.6 rpg, 7.1 apg, 52-35-76%, 30.1 PER, .283 WS/48\nNow thats a dip. He also missed 13 games after missing 32 combined in the seven previous years. Throw in the mild defensive slippage and its fair to wonder, \"Is Apex LeBron gone?\" Or hes just biding his time until Round 3 and Round 4 and this section is going to look absolutely moronic in eight weeks. Either way, this wasnt a 93 MJ or 97 MJ situation -- its the first time since 2008-09 when we honestly dont know if LeBron James is still the NBAs best player. Just another reason why I loved this season. I love upheaval and uncertainty!\nWe cant dismiss Hardens week-to-week brilliance for Houston; or Westbrooks remarkable run after the All-Star break, when he turned into \n; or Chris Pauls incredible January-to-April run carrying a severely flawed Clippers team; or the Brow blossoming into The Next Superduperstar Forward; or even LeBron rejuvenating the Cavaliers and altering the course of Kyrie Irvings career (no small feat).\nBut around 2007, I remember praising Nash for being the only \"driver\" who could have handled the race car that was \n; they were like a special Ferrari built for his exact qualities. You could say the same about Curry and 2015s Porsche Warriors. Hes the best driver for the best car -- the defining pace-and-space team for a new generation of basketball, someone good enough to jack eight 3s a game since the All-Star break \n. And as I tried to describe in \n, theres nothing like the experience of seeing the Warriors in person when Curry catches fire. Nothing. I thought he owned this season.\nLast Curry point: I grew up with my father telling me, \n I always felt cheated that I never caught Pistol Pete in his prime; by the time he landed on the Celtics in 1980, he was pretty much washed up. Fast-forward 35 years: Isnt Curry really Pistol Pete reincarnated as a more efficient, more unselfish model? How could Pistol Pete have been MORE fun than this?\nOver everything else, Stephen Curry \n He won over opposing crowds, flipped the collective energy in arenas, put the fear of God in opponents, changed the course of games within 90 seconds. This was a virtuoso performance that included staggeringly good individual efficiency and once-a-decade team success. When I think about the 2014-15 regular season, I will remember Curry and the Warriors first ... and then Ill remember everyone else. Hes my MVP.\n\n\nQuick reminder of the trophy weights: 40 pounds (\"only defining seasons from signature players can qualify,\" like 09 LeBron or 00 Shaq); 25 pounds (\"A smaller, gutted-it-out trophy for a future Hall of Famer who prevails in an especially memorable race,\" like 1990 Magic over 1990 MJ); 10 pounds (\"a stereotypical rock-solid MVP season,\" like 2008 Kobe or 1994 Hakeem); 5 pounds (\"lack-of-consensus MVP seasons in which we kinda-sorta-maybe had to talk ourselves into a candidate because there wasnt a clear winner,\" like 2011 Rose or 2005 Nash); and the 1-pound Wimbledon platter (\"stumbling into an NBA MVP trophy [because] somebody had to win,\" like 78 Walton, 81 Doc or 06 Nash).\nWell, 2015 was an undeniably memorable race (along with 1987, 1990 and 1993, one of the four best of the past 30 years) ... and Steph Curry is a future Hall of Famer (if he stays healthy) ... and Curry definitely gutted out that award (we dont even know if he won). So Im awarding 25-pound status for the 2015 trophy.\nThe rest of my 2015 awards ballot, since were here: Andrew Wiggins for rookie (over Noel and Mirotic); Lou Williams for sixth man (over Isaiah Thomas); Steve Kerr for coach (over Budz and Pop); Kawhi for DPOY (over Draymond); the Stifle Tower for most improved (over Draymond and Butler); Lance Stephenson for LVP (over Josh Smith); and Byron Scott for non-coach of the year (over Derek Fisher and Randy Wittman). Speaking of Byron ...\nBS: I think its more fun to watch him play Unfrozen Caveman NBA Coach. \nBS: Um, zero! Were here! I always wanted an NBA Jim Caldwell. Its too bad that Wittman doesnt have an NFL equivalent; you cant run the Clogged Toilet offense in football. Well have to wait for an NFL coach who spends every first and second down running the ball into the middle of the line, then every third down throwing it 25 yards downfield. Maybe this will be Jim Tomsulas new offense for the 49ers. I mean, would you rule out anything incompetent with the 49ers at this point?\n\n\nBS: I will! Thank you! Although I cant bring myself to call him \"IT4\" because it makes him sound like he just showed up to fix my laptop. We call him \"Baby Zeke\" in my house. I love that everyone is writing off President Stevens, Baby Zeke, Jae Crowder and the 2011 Butler Bulldogs-- er, 2015 Boston Celtics in Round 1. Please, \n. Well see you in Game 6, Cleveland ... when LeBron gets mad and drops 52 on us to finish the series off, but still, well see you in Game 6!!!!\nBS: Youre asking me to come up with a worse example for facial hair than something you just described as a \"chin pube fro?\" I think Father Kelly has the title.\nBS: Hmmmmmm. Youre really asking me to decide on 2015s Donald Sterling Award, given out annually to the professional sports owner who has the lowest approval rating with his own fans? And with Sterling gone, that makes Dolan the Meryl Streep of this category; you always have to nominate him even if he didnt have a particularly memorable year. After all, the Knicks play in Americas biggest city, theyve floundered for this entire century, and theyve alienated five generations of fans ranging from first graders to people in their nineties at this point. \n.\nBut heres a relatively recent catch with Dolan: Because his Rangers have been thriving recently, that means its not IMPOSSIBLE that Dolan could own a quality NBA franchise. Right? (Thinking.) Youre right, its probably impossible. But in Jimmy Busss case, it actually \n impossible -- he couldnt run a Jack in the Box, much less the Lakers. Still, everyone knows hes getting pushed out by \n soon. And also, hes just been more hopeless and sad and overmatched than anything. I live in Los Angeles and dont know any Lakers fan who actually hates Jimmy Buss. Hes the closest well ever come in real life to Fredo running the Corleones. I feel bad even writing this paragraph.\nOur dishonorable mention candidates: San Francisco legacy kid bumbler Jed York (transformed the 49ers from a perennial contender into a laughingstock in about 20 minutes); Miamis Bizarro Robin Hood, Jeffrey Loria (2013 \n headline: \"\n\"); and Clevelands just-about-a-criminal Jimmy Haslam (he bought the downtrodden Browns in 2012 and did some mega-trodding, \n, two GMs and a CEO while \n, \n, allowing the Browns to be immortalized in the Bad Sports Movie Pantheon in \n, and shepherding the team through a series of losing seasons while \n and \n and \n and \n).\nThen again, nobody has a lower fan approval rating than Washingtons Daniel Snyder, who inspired me to \n based on the premise, \n When D.C. sports guru Dan Steinberg tossed that question to his readers, more than 80 percent of them responded \"YES!!!!!\" Now thats a disapproval rating! Nobody is topping Daniel Snyder right now. Sorry, Jimmy Dolan haters.\n\n\nBS: So everyone gets the same amount of lottery balls like always, but if Philly wins a top-three pick, they just slide into the no. 4 spot and thats that? Fine by me. Id also create a \"no NBA team can win the first pick twice in a five-year span\" rule. Why is the NBA so desperate to help franchises that are either (a) poorly run, or (b) trying to lose? Have we ever figured this out?\n\n\nBS: You guessed right. And you also guessed right that I stole two straight questions from last nights \n mailbag. To be fair, even Sacramentos organizational dumpster fire of a brain trust wouldnt be dumb enough to deal Boogie this summer unless Boogie and agent Dan Fegan pushed hard for it. But if you were Boogie and Fegan and you just lived through five coaches, nine point guards, two owners, two GMs (plus Chris Mullin and Vlade Divac) and five lottery appearances, wouldnt you push for the chance to get away from the Sacramento Kings of Comedy? No jury would convict them. I came up with three Boogie Summer Trade medalists without including the Celtics and their armada of future first-rounders.\n -- What about Giannis, Zaza Pachulia and Milwaukees no. 17 pick to Sacramento for Boogie? I already factored in the fact that wed have to cancel the first 20 games of next season because it would take six months for America to rebuild the Internet after a Boogie-for-Giannis trade broke it. But if Im the Kings, I want a blue-chipper/possible franchise guy back for Boogie. And if Im the Bucks, deep down, I know Giannis might be kinda sorta maybe slightly expendable with Jabari Parker returning next season. Could you build a contender around Boogie, Jabari, Khris Middleton (assuming they re-sign him), MCW (if they can turn him into a decent shooter), all of their role players, Jason Kidds excellent coaching staff and a couple of savvy signings? I awarded this a bronze only because I dont think Milwaukee has the balls to trade Giannis (even if hes been clashing with Kidd lately). You dont want the T-Mac/Durant scoring fetus to come back and haunt you in three years.\n(My verdict: I dont think Milwaukee should put Giannis on the table. Its just fun to discuss.)\n -- Lets say they win a top-two pick, even if the odds dipped a little after Derek Fishers boys beat Atlanta on an unusually devastating night even for the always-devastated Knicks fans. Would you flip the rights to Karl-Anthony Towns or Jahlil Okafor for Cousins? And what would be more fun than Boogie in New York? Anything?\n(My verdict: Id do it if I were Sacramento ... but I wouldnt do it if I were the Knicks. Instead, Id draft Towns or Okafor and spend Boogies money on a free agent.)\n -- Your clear favorites. In July, the Magic could whip out a Nikola Vucevic/top-five 2015 pick package and maybe even throw in their future Lakers pick just to show off.\n Thats a monster haul for the Kings of Comedy -- theyd replace 75 percent of Boogies stats with Vucevic (locked up through 2019) and get DAngelo Russell or Justise Winslow AND that Lakers pick. And Orlando could build around their electric Elfrid Payton-Victor Oladipo backcourt, Boogie, Aaron Gordon and Tobias Harris (if they re-sign him), plus cap space galore.\n(My verdict: yes for Orlando, no for Sacramento unless Boogie unequivocally says, \"GET ME OUT OF HERE.\")\nBS: As a Red Sox fan who just lived through 2004, 2007 and 2013, I dont believe in sports curses anymore. But I also \n, and I still believe that team was \n, and I still think David Stern handled that situation like a drunken nanny who wandered away from the playground for 45 minutes and then cant believe that the kid she was supposed to be watching was suddenly nowhere to be seen. So if Seattle fans wanted to make \"CURSE OF THE ZOMBIE SONICS\" T-shirts that looked like OKC Thunder colors, and they wanted to start wearing them around the city and stuff ... I mean, could you blame them?\nBS: Yup, thats my dad (with the big mustache), with my Uncle Don sitting next to him. I cant tell if we should be praising my father for being seemingly so unflustered that a maniac was dancing next to him, or making fun of him because he was actually sleeping with his eyes open the entire time. I also cant tell if I should be proud or insulted that more people have seen my dad in this YouTube clip than every Grantland clip Ive been in combined.\nBS: Yup. Youre never gonna go wrong with WWBBD or WWGPD for Belichick and the Spurs. A forgotten blip in NBA history -- Pop shutting Tim Duncan down for the 2000 playoffs, and passing up a chance to repeat as champs, over further damaging Duncans torn meniscus. \n, \"[Duncan] was young, a franchise player. He wasnt just a No. 1 pick. With him, youve got an opportunity to win multiple championships, if you dont screw it up. I didnt know if [the injury] could get worse, or get chronic.\" You mean, like a broken foot that had to be repaired two more times? Should we be worried that Westbrook and Durant had six combined surgeries for two injuries? Who is the head of OKCs medical staff, Dr. Dre?\n\n\nBS: Great call. Youd get Blake and DeAndre hitting clubs and chasing the ladies. Youd get Blake and DeAndre bitching about Chris Paul being condescending to them. Youd get the special episode when Austin Rivers comes to visit and Blake and DeAndre get him bombed. Youd get the reality-TV experience of Matt Barnes, as well as relentless drop-ins from his ex-wife and his ex-sister-in-law (the Govan sisters, two seasoned reality vets). And youd get J.J. Redick just trying to fit in. Id watch the hell out of that show. Thats not your winner, though.\nSome good runner-up candidates: Denver (youd get Ty Lawson, Jusuf Nurkic, Kenneth Faried AND legalized marijuana), Milwaukee (good god, its the \"Larry Sanders is back in town!\" episode), Sacramento (Boogie and Rudy Gay \n) and Cleveland (you cant sleep on Kevin Loves potential in a \n-type situation).\nBut heres your NBA/\n winner: the Phoenix Suns. You know, the team I \n as, \"If you put all 30 NBA teams in the same nightclub, the Suns would be the ones that kept getting kicked out for reasons like We didnt like the way Blake Griffin was looking at us and Who does Draymond Green think he is????\" Youre not topping Alex Len, P.J. Tucker and Markieff Morris living in the same \n house, especially when Marcus Morris keeps sleeping on the sofa because he refuses to be left out of the show. Its just not happening. Cant this just be a show? Whats stopping us?\nBS: We know this much: From a \"Who the F are these guys?\" standpoint, the NBA should worry only about Atlanta crashing the Finals. In the past 35 years, the only teams seeded lower than no. 3 that made the Finals were the 1981 Rockets (no. 6), 1995 Rockets (no. 6), 1999 Knicks (no. 8 in a lockout season), 2006 Mavs (no. 4) and 2010 Celtics (no. 4). Thats five times in 35 years! You have an 86 percent chance of seeing two of the following 2015 Finals opponents: Golden State, Houston or the Clippers, and Atlanta, Cleveland or Chicago.\nTranslation: Atlanta is the only \n 2015 Finals party-crasher that would make NBA higher-ups say \"Dammit!\" Or would they??? Lets rip through the pluses and minuses of the Hawks making the 2015 Finals.\nPluses: The NBAs best rags-to-riches story in years ... the Hawks havent sniffed the Finals since 1961 (when they played in St. Louis) ... Grantlands special Finals series, \"Rembert Explains Atlanta While Spontaneously Combusting\" ... its impossible, and probably illegal, to dislike Al Horford or Paul Millsap ... wed get German Rondo, Pero Antic, Kent Bazemore doing Kent Bazemore things AND Kyle Korver doing Kyle Korver things ... wed get our first resident in-game Finals DJ ... wed get Buckhead!!!! ... wed get Barkley in Buckhead! ... wed get Jalen in Buckhead!!!! ... Hawks-Warriors would feature the most diverse crowds, by far, in NBA Finals history ... this is important: ITS REALLY FUN TO WATCH THE HAWKS PLAY BASKETBALL BECAUSE THEY PLAY BEAUTIFULLY TOGETHER ... theres a Tree of Pop scenario if its Hawks-Warriors or Hawks-Spurs ... oh, and Atlanta pro sports fans have rooted for exactly one championship team since 1958 (the 95 Braves during the shortened post-strike season when everyone hated baseball).\nMinuses: I hate typing this because I love watching them, but the 15 Hawks would unequivocally be our most anonymous Finals team since the 76 Suns ... wed also miss out on LeBron-Kyrie-Love in the Finals (ouch) ... lets just say that the Hawks have a buttload of baggage that would get relentlessly dragged up during the Finals (crazy owner beefs, front-office racial scandals, DUIs, alleged NYPD assaults, you name it) ... Atlanta is Americas strangest big city because it doesnt have a discernible downtown, which makes it a quagmire for \"big sporting event purposes\" (theres no epicenter and its a traffic disaster)\n ... if ABC got stuck with San Antonio-Atlanta, theyd have to save the Finals ratings by replacing Jeff Van Gundy, Mark Jackson and Mike Breen with Shonda Rhimes, Kerry Washington and Viola Davis ... and lets be honest: \"LeBrons trilogy battle against Kawhi and Duncan\" OR \"LeBron and Kyrie vs. the Splash Brothers\" OR \"LeBron and Kyrie vs. CP3 and Blake\" -- I mean, all of those scenarios seem more entertaining than \"Hawks vs. Anyone,\" and thats before we bring up the whole \"Cleveland Is Americas Most Tortured Sports City\" angle.\nAdd everything up and theres some undeniable 1999 Pacers/2001 Bucks/2002 Kings potential here for the 2015 Hawks. The good news: Officiating is better than it was during that 1999-2003 WWE era, and theres more internal accountability for poor performance, as well as YouTube and GIFs and Vines lingering over everything (and a score of Internet detectives ready to pounce). The bad news: The way Cleveland is playing now, I cant imagine them blowing Round 3 to an overachieving team that has only one defender to throw at LeBron. Its just too far-fetched. Vegas bumped them to -230 to win the East for a reason.\nBS: I am making seven gambling recommendations, and only seven ...\n\nJust parlay that number with Floyd to beat Manny (-210) and thank me after Memorial Day. Nobody is beating Floyd and nobody is beating Cleveland. You could have maybe talked me into the Hawks if they were running on all cylinders and I had two drinks in me, but after the NYPD took out Thabo Sefolosha for reasons that remain ludicrously unclear, I dont see how Atlanta beats Cleveland four times.\n\nKnow this: Steve Kerr was watching those last games and cheering for OKC and San Antonio. The Warriors would have destroyed OKCs putrid defense; they would have averaged 125 points per game. And theyre going to beat New Orleans too. But youre not sweeping the Brow. Hes too good. And if he can drag the Pelicans to a Game 6 or even (gasp) a Game 7, hes our best bet to win the Internet in Round 1 like Damian Lillard did last year. Other decent possibilities: Brad Stevens, Kyrie Irving, the Greek Freak, Nikola Mirotic, Austin Rivers (now THAT would be a story!), Josh Smith (ditto), Isaiah Thomas, Monta Ellis, Tyreke Evans (an intriguing dark horse pick), and, of course, the Splash Brothers.\n\nTake the under. I cant believe Deron Williams and Joe Johnson crashed the 2015 playoffs; I thought \n already had its last episode. And why isnt this entire series showing exclusively on NBA TV? Whats the point of having NBA TV if not for this series?\n\nHold on ...\nHold on ...\nI just wanted to savor that one for a second. Looks so great on the screen. Dont actually bet this.\n\nHeres the smart bet. President Stevens isnt getting swept. Baby Zeke isnt getting swept. Jae Crowder and Marcus Smart and Avery Bradley arent getting swept. There will be one game in this series -- in Cleveland, in Boston, doesnt matter -- when the Cavs are sleepwalking and the Celtics just \n more. You watch. And by the way, everyone counted out Stevens in 2010 and then again in 2011 after Gordon Hayward left. And everyone counted out Hickory High in 1952. I better get out of this paragraph before I change this bet to Cavs in six (+500). \n\nTake the over. And take the over if its 300, 325 or 350, because this is gonna be a hack-a-thon -- Rondo on one side, Howard/Dorsey/Smith/Capela on the other. All credit goes to Zach Lowe for sniffing this out first and convincing us to spend a \n segment discussing it last night; every NBA postseason, some goofy story line emerges that inadvertently dominates the 24/7 talking head landscape until we beat it into the ground. Zach believes that, between Clips-Spurs and Rockets-Mavs, 2015s story line could be How To Fix Hack-A-Whomever. Great call. Totally agree. Houston-Dallas has a chance to be one clunky, ugly, ridiculous, way-more-forgettable-than-you-think series. (I hope not.)\n\nI just dont see any scenario in the next month in which youd say to yourself, \n You can always hedge before the Western finals if the idea of Spurs-GSW or Clips-GSW frightens you in any way. Speaking of the Spurs ...\n\nThe Spurs are semi-heavily favored to win the series (-185) even though the Clippers have home court, which means Doc will be pushing the \"NOBODY BELIEVES IN US\" story line hard these next two weeks. For that and many other reasons (a possible last stand for Duncan and Manu, Kawhi defending CP3, San Antonio taking Hack-A-Shaq to new [and hideous] extremes with DeAndre Jordan, Pop and Doc lobbing darts at each other, Tony Parker doing Tony Parker things, Blake Griffin and CP3 realizing the stakes and going into Dom Toretto/Ride-Or-Die mode), I believe this will be one of the most memorable Round 1 NBA series of the 21st century. Its going six or seven. So if you think the Spurs will prevail, why not bet \"Spurs in six\" AND \"Spurs in seven?\"\nPersonally, I think it could go seven for two reasons. First, its too great of a matchup -- on one hand, you have the Spurs trying to put a cherry on the Duncan-Pop Hot Fudge Sundae by winning back-to-back titles,\n and on the other, you have a famous Clippers trio thats been together for four years, hasnt even made it to Round 3 and might be in its own Last Stand situation with DeAndres free agency coming. This Spurs-Clips series is fundamentally \n for Round 1. Thats what makes it so great. I cant imagine this being a dud. Too improbable.\nAnd second, Game 7 would happen on Saturday night, May 2, West Coast time ... which would likely put the game head-to-head against Manny-Floyd in one of the all-time TV channel-flipping conundrums in the history of TV channel-flipping conundrums. Its so frightening, so overwhelming, so insane that it almost HAS to happen. Its destiny. Its meant to be the Greatest Sports Night In Recent History. So imagine having the Spurs +600 that night. Sign me up. Enjoy the playoffs, everybody. (And dont forget to watch \n -- tonight, 7 ET, ESPN!)"}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-mailbag-reunion-tour-continues/", "blog_text": "Before we tackle a few mailbag questions, I need to jack up some shots to get loose. Lets rip through a few quick Round 1 awards. Stand under the basket and rebound for me, please. Seriously. Go down there. And throw me nice, crisp passes right at my chest. Thanks. Here we go.\nGame 1 of Clips-Spurs featured two all-time Blake dunks; the best-ever CP3-and-Blake-peaking-in-the-same-game performance; Aron Baynes being defiled in so many different ways that everyone in Staples Center kept waiting for the Gimp from \n to climb out of a trunk; a Jamal Crawford heat check; an uncharacteristically tremendous crowd (about 99 percent pro-Clips, which is atypical); and everyone realizing at the same time, \"Holy shit, the Clips might be able to make the Finals with seven guys!\" In 10 years of owning Clips season tickets, thats the fourth-best Clips game Ive ever attended, trailing only Game 7 of Warriors-Clips in 2014, \n and the unforgettable 2007 contest when Tim Thomas played 30 minutes without ever crossing either 3-point line.\nIn Game 3 against Golden State, the Pelicans blew a 55-point fourth-quarter lead in less than four minutes (all numbers approximate) in such an unsurprising meltdown that (a) I had to catch a 6:11 a.m. Acela train this morning from Boston to New York, (b) I was lying in my hotel bed at midnight thinking to myself, \n, and (c) I stayed awake only because the Warriors AND Monty Williams were involved. Any member of the 400-Hour Club (those who have watched more than 400 hours of League Pass this season) learned by December never to give up on a seemingly insurmountable Pelicans lead or Warriors deficit. This was the perfect storm.\nAdditional note for the history nerds out there: For the 2015 Warriors to go down as an all-time team, they need to win the title AND finish 16-4 in the playoffs AND sweep at least two series AND submit a few memorable lay-the-smack-down games along the way AND create three or four iconic moments (like Currys game-saving Shoulda-Been-A-Four-Pointer). Game 3 was everything I wanted from them. Great teams come through on the road when they dont have it. Well remember that one.\nObviously this goes to the polarizing former All-Star from the Mavs-Rockets series who graduated from Oak Hill and changed teams during the season ... so, congratulations to Jo-- wait, its not Josh Smith?\nThe violent, grisly, emotionally scarring and unexpectedly abrupt death of Playoff Rondo ranks right up there with the end of \n for me. I loved Playoff Rondo almost as much as I loved National TV Rondo. Those two guys represented everything I love and hate about sports all wrapped into the same perplexing package -- the audacity of someone telling us during most regular-season games, \n coupled with the brilliance of someone who could say, \nI would love to know how my wife handled it if we were to go out for dinner once a week for four weeks, and every time, I wouldnt say that much and would act weird but make just enough jokes to make the dinner passable ... only every time we went out with another couple, Id be hilarious and gregarious and charismatic and keep telling everyone, \"Youre with Double-Date Simmons tonight!!!!!\" You know what would happen? Shed dump Double Date Simmons and Regular Season Simmons. Only in sports can you pull off the idea of Playoff Rondo. And now its dead. R.I.P.\nDallas gambled (AND ruined their bench AND wasted a first-round pick) by flagrantly violating the \"You can get away with one head case, just dont give him someone to hang out with\" rule by teaming up Monta Ellis and Rondo. And even worse, they never considered things like, \"Should we be worried that Rick Carlisle is a control freak who wants constant ball movement and Rondo loves to dominate the ball and control everything?\" and \"Should we be worried that Rondo cant get to the line, cant make free throws and cant shoot 3s even though were in the pace-and-space/3s-and-free-throws era?\" What a quietly devastating trade for them. Now theyre getting swept and have a future built around a winding-it-down Dirk, Chandler Parsons, cap space, Carlisle and Cubes. Yikes. And even worse, this whole thing led to Sad Dirk! I hate Sad Dirk!\nMe. For everything in the previous paragraph. See, I absolutely LOVED the Rondo trade for Dallas and thought he was a semi-shell of himself in Boston only because he was playing possum. I havent misfired like that since ... oh, wait, Im wrong all the time. On the bright side, we finally got to watch an NBA star carry himself in playoff games with the exact same enthusiasm as a divorced dad ringing the doorbell of his ex-wifes house.\n And even better, I just won a Roger Goodell Award!\nRondo lost between $30 million and $40 million this summer with that Mavericks fiasco. On the bright side, drunk Lakers fans and drunk Knicks fans everywhere are texting their friends, \"Dp you think we csn get Ronddo at a bigf disconyt?\"\nRandy Wittman winning two straight in Toronto while battling the usual stuff that comes with coaching a team that just spent the season underachieving, sucking the life out of its fans and taking the Clogged Toilet offense to new heights. Two days after Wittman submitted one of the funniest Vines ever (saving it for later) and just hours after Grantlands Andrew Sharp explained the \n, the Ex-Bullets owned Game 2 and played their finest two hours under Wittman. Now you have D.C. fans like my buddy House saying, \"We could absolutely beat the Hawks in Round 2 even if we get outcoached, as long as we dont get TOTALLY outcoached.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX5jNnDMfxA.\nYEAH!!!!!!! WITTMAN!!!!!!!\nSpurs-Clips is wildly overqualified for Round 1, which is the biggest reason its so damned fun -- the NBA equivalent of throwing Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson into eight \n episodes. Game 1? Unbelievable. Game 2? That one had the intensity, weightiness, electricity and sophistication of an actual Finals game; got derailed by Hack-A-DeAndre and some uncharacteristically horrific Pop/Doc coaching; featured multiple bricks and multiple turnovers and multiple stars coming up short ... and yet I absolutely loved being there for it. Sometimes youre watching a game and you just \n that it might become a horrendous, kicking-yourself-for-years defeat for EITHER team. It ended up being the Clippers. Well see if it lingers.\n(Quick aside: Ive been sharing Clips tickets with my friend Tollin since 2008, when I was about to give them up and he said, \"Wait, you cant give them up. What if they become good?\" And then we both laughed for about 20 seconds before I said, \"Screw it, one more year.\" Anyway, we were walking out after Game 2 and Tollin said, \"Spurs-Clippers ... its just never gonna change with these guys, is it?\" In other words, the Spurs continue to be the hammer and the Clippers continue to be the nail.)\nDeron Williamss wide-open 16-footer that would have tied Game 2 in Atlanta (and didnt). I never thought that thing was going in. Not for one second. \"CP3 or Deron?\" is starting to feel more dated than \"Jay Z or Nas?\"\nSo Nic Batum has hated Spain for years because of the well-documented Spain-France international basketball rivalry, he jokingly posted a \"WE DONT LOSE TO SPANISH PLAYERS\" sign in their locker room ... and that became a Shame Police story for two days? I dont know one person -- seriously, not one -- who would be offended by that sign. Do I just have the wrong people in my life? Are my friends and family doing a terrible job of protecting society? Should I start taking an outrage booster? Do they sell outrage boosters? Is there a class that can teach me how to make morally superior, out-of-context shame police tweets?\nI made a New York City work trip much harder by squeezing a 7 a.m. Thursday flight to Boston into the mix just to watch my underdog Celtics (hopefully) topple LeBron and the Cavs. Didnt happen. Turns out that its a problem when the other team has the three best players in a playoff series, including one of the eight best players of all time.\nBut you know what? How many of these LeBronian playoff eviscerations are left? You know, the ones when he shows up in someone elses house and breaks windows and plates and tables for two hours as 15,000 to 20,000 exuberant people slowly lose the will to live? Maybe ... 15? Does he have 20? I mean, hes closing in on 44,000 minutes by the end of this postseason. You never know. Getting to see him in Queen of the Chessboard mode -- the ultimate power guard, the ultimate mismatch, the ultimate athlete, the ultimate thinker, and of course, the ultimate crybaby who somehow hasnt committed a foul since he returned to the Cavs (sorry, I had to) -- was worth the cross-country flight and the two early alarm blares. Now that theyve figured out the right people to throw around him (as well as the right style), and now that hes in the right shape, hes still the most dangerous basketball player alive. LeBron was, I dont know, maybe EIGHT PERCENT better two years ago during his Miami apex? Just an amazing experience to watch that dude do his thing as my Boston brethren booed him and yelled insults at him. I loved it. Im glad I went back.\nHey, everybody, its the reeling Raptors! Would Indy trade George Hill and the no. 11 pick for DeMar DeRozan?\n Would Sacramento pony up Darren Collison, Sauce Castillo and the no. 6 pick for Kyle Lowry? Would Denver take the 20th pick and Terrence Ross for Danilo Gallinari? Would the Lakers flip Julius Randle for DeRozan so they could clear the 4-spot for Kevin Love? What kind of Godfather offer for Andrew Wiggins would Flip Saunders have the pleasure of rejecting? What if the Raptors landed no. 6 and no. 11 in Lowry/DeRozan trades, then offered those picks to Flip -- along with Torontos juicy pick in the 2016 Nuggets-Knicks-Raptors pick swap (Denver gets first choice, Toronto gets second choice, Knicks get nothing and like it) -- for the rights to acquire Maple Jordan? What if Flip countered by saying, \"You have to throw in Jonas too\"?\nDerrick Rose suddenly looking kinda maybe sorta like Derrick Rose again. (Note: Im obeying all jinxing rules.) Even if they dont make it past Round 2, hes reclaimed enough of his trade value that, at the very least, Knicks fans are now petrified that Phil Jackson might flip their top-three pick for Rose in two months. Baby steps. Good time to morph into a mini-mailbag. As always, these are actual questions from actual readers.\nBS: So much for obeying all jinxing rules. Heres your current top five:\n MJ, Utah, 1998. Greatest player ever caps off the greatest three-year run ever with his greatest feat (beating the Jazz basically by himself in Utah in Game 6) and the greatest thing Ive ever seen a basketball player do (the iconic layup-steal-jumper sequence). How are we topping that?\n A running-on-fumes Celtics dynasty winning its last title (11 out of 13!) even though (a) player-coach Bill Russell and crunch-time god Sam Jones were retiring after the season, (b) they didnt have home court in any playoff series, (c) they were heavy Finals dogs against a Lakers team that had Wilt, Elgin AND West, (d) three of their four Finals games were won in the final minute, (e) they won Game 7 on the road partly because a pissed-off Russell had stumbled upon the Lakers elaborate postgame plan for a balloon celebration. The greatest winner in sports history going out in the greatest way possible? Come on.\n The 2014 Spurs redeem the worst Finals loss ever while simultaneously murdering the LeBron era in Miami.\n Magic, 1980, Game 6.\n Willis, Game 7, 1970.\nHeres what I love about Roses story (if it plays out in the best possible way): Its like a sports movie, right? Local kid wins MVP, signs two huge contracts with the Bulls and Adidas, blows out his knee, comes back, keeps getting hurt, never gives up ... and suddenly hes holding a Finals MVP, crying on the podium and hugging his mom (played by Octavia Spencer) and his brother (played by Anthony Anderson). \"Based on a true story: Michael B. Jordan plays Derrick Rose in \n\" Thats definitely a top-four all-time NBA playoff story if it happens. You could also talk me into Matt Damon gaining 25 pounds to play an embattled but dedicated NBA coach who keeps getting railroaded and undercut by his front office, then shoves it in their faces by winning a title in the heartwarming Disney movie \nBS: My defense, only because I hate being wrong: Couldnt you say that more people than ever are selling their regular-season tickets, then holding on to their playoff seats? Lets see how Games 3 and 4 play out.\nBS: And I was a single bartender \nfor a website that could only be accessed by people with AOL accounts. On the bright side, I DID know how to masturbate. Wait a second, how the hell did you pull me into Weirdoville? Get me out of here!\n\n\nBS: Yeah, thats your Bird and Magic of the 2015 LVP so far. Its a two-man race. Honorable mention: Dame Lillard (even earned a rare TV upbraid from Barkley), Kyle Lowry (is he hurt???), Dirk Nowitzki (for defensive reasons only), Omer Asik (a plus-minus calamity), Masai Ujiri (for freezing at the trade deadline), Kelly Olynyk (could someone tell him the playoffs started?), Lionel Hollins (for not having the balls to just bench Deron), Clevelands crowd (did you ever think Miami would have given LeBron a better playoff atmosphere than Cleveland????)\n and Rondo a second time.\nBS: The only four things that would excite Boston fans less than a Rondo return: another 109 inches of snow next winter; the \n announcing that it had re-signed Dan Shaughnessy for another 15 years; Boston winning \n; and the Red Sox signing Rick Porcello to a four-year, $82.5 million contract extension. (Listening.) Wait, what????\nBS: Definitely Rick Rondo, a name that makes him sound like a porn actor, WWE star or twin insurance agent. Are we sure Rick Rondo wasnt the guy that Boston sent to Dallas three months ago? Your best case for a Rondo resurgence next season: If Dennis Rodman can average 15 rebounds per game in Chicago and win a ring 12 months after his 1995 Spurs flame-out that reverse-peaked with Rodman taking his sneakers off \n, Im pretty sure we cant write off Rondo yet.\nBS: Tough mailbag for Rondo. Tough times. None of this makes me happy. On the other hand, much like T.J. Lavin, I \n. And Rondo quit on Dallas. He did.\nBS: Id rather get \"Tony\" going for Anthony Davis. Watch Game 4 of Pels-Warriors and scream out \"Toe-neee!\" the first time Davis throws down an alley-oop. It feels surprisingly good. \"Tony\" gives Davis a little extra danger; suddenly hes the muscle-head who might take his shirt off in the club and try to fight a bouncer.\nBS: Everyone reading this column has one week to trump \n in a new game that well call \"Find someone who has the exact same name as a celebrity, but also has a ridiculous job that somehow ties into how ridiculous the celebrity is.\" (Cut to thousands of people Googling \"Roger Goodell, sewage specialist.\")\nBS: I dont mean to anger Rip City, but we have to discuss this one. You could make a \n case for Aldridge being in play this summer. It will be Year 10 for him; he needs to win now. He just lost Wesley Matthews, and theres no looming sign that Portland will ever find that third piece to put that team over the hump. Hes not nearly famous enough for someone who was one of the leagues 10 best players for two straight years. Hes from Dallas and attended the University of Texas, which opens up going-back-home possibilities in San Antonio (Duncans replacement?), Dallas (the Mavs new franchise guy?) AND Houston (his best chance for a quickie Finals trip).\nThen again, Houston wouldnt be his team; it already belongs to Harden. Dallas is heading in the wrong direction and already sent its top-seven-protected pick to Boston next season; I dont see how thats a better basketball situation than Portlands this summer. As for San Antonio ... I mean, would YOU want to replace Tim Duncan and spend the rest of your career being compared to him? That answer could go either way, I guess. The good side: Pop, Spurs, Kawhi, infrastructure, first-class fans. The bad side: If it doesnt go splendidly, you become The Guy Who Screwed It Up After Duncan Left.\nWhich makes me think Orlando (assets + talent + youth + Florida), Boston (assets + youth + role players + President Stevens + great owner/front office) and New York (biggest market, Carmelo, top-three pick, cap space) could be legitimate LaMarcus players here. Four months ago, I would have said it was a 99 percent chance he stayed. Right now, it has to be 50/50. And dropping. If it means something to him to retire in Portland someday, hell stay. If not, hell leave. But its definitely not the best basketball situation for him. And by the way, Lillard is the Blazer getting commercials these days, not Aldridge. If you dont think that matters to these guys, youre crazy.\nBS: By a landslide. We canceled the vote. He also won the \"NBA Player Who Easily Could Have Appeared On a Mumblecore Movie Poster\" award.\n\n\nBS: Im giddy, Im relieved, Im overwhelmed ... I feel like Jonas Salk after he found out that his vaccine worked.\n[protected-iframe id=\"291d02404b72d92eb3a0667cd2934767-60203239-57815212 info=\"https://vine.co/v/ezttEPM33jn/embed/simple\" width=\"600 height=\"600 frameborder=\"0]\n\n\nBS: It cant be ruled out. Important Duncan note that jumps out when you watch him in person ... \n Like, he drags it around as if it were a prosthetic. That thing does NOT work. He does everything off his right leg. Everything. Tim Duncan is amazing. YEAR EIGHTEEN!!!!! Is there any objective NBA fan who wouldnt have rather had Duncan from 1997 to now instead of Kobe from 1997 to 2015 if the only objectives were \"I want to try to win 55-65 games every year and I want to try to win multiple titles\"? How can you pass up 18 straight years of Duncan? Only Kareem and Mailman were able to stay that good for that long. Fact: Tim Duncan is older than Brad Stevens. Fact: It doesnt seem to matter. And no, it still hasnt been explained to me why Duncan would retire yet. The quality of his game, night to night, hasnt changed for five solid years. Well, except that hes playing on one leg.\nBS: Your reseeded first round for 2015: Warriors-Celtics (1/16), Hawks-Bucks (2/15), Rockets-Thunder (3/14), Clippers-Pelicans (4/13), Grizzlies-Wizards (5/12), Spurs-Raptors (6/11), Cavs-Mavs (7/10), Blazers-Bulls (8/9). I mean ... thats an even worse Round 1 than the current one, right? But dont worry: When I take over as President Hillarys sports czar in 2017, all American professional sports leagues will be forced to adopt a \"You have to finish .500 or better to make the playoffs\" rule and well never have to worry about things like the dead-eyed Nets making the playoffs over Westbrook and the Thunder again.\nBS: All footage of Yi posting up the chair has been wiped away from the Internet (probably on orders from the Chinese government), although we still have this rare workout clip of Chairman Yi dominating the Invisible Man ...\n... as well as \n of Yi sitting on a chair that Ill drop later in the column for comedic purposes. Hold tight.\n\n\nBS: Putting \"Lossie for the Aussie\" and \"Skimmin for Simmons\" as placeholders until the readers can top it. Stay tuned.\nBS: Get ready to lose an even bigger chunk of fandom -- I had no idea that Lou Williams had two girlfriends. Doesnt this make sense, though? Lou Williams is really two basketball players -- theres the Lou Williams who single-handedly sways games a la Jamal Crawford, and then theres the Lou Williams who models his game after a poor mans hybrid of Randy Foye and Dion Waiters and has absolutely no problem going 4-for-18. Maybe each of those guys needed their own lady. Now we need to arrange a quadruple date with Good Lou Williams, Bad Lou Williams, Rajon Rondo and Rick Rondo.\nBS: It would have to be something really egregious and \n unrealistic -- like LeBron failing to bring Cleveland a title, then ditching Cleveland in his prime on a live television special so he could team up with Wade and Bosh in Miami, winning two titles for the Heat and making four straight Finals, then heroically returning to Cleveland like nothing ever happened.\nBS: Didnt that fit in with the rest of Bradley Beals letdown season, though? He went backward in every way. Earlier this month, I sent \n to Wizards fans House and Sharp with the sentence, \"Bradley Beal is your Ron Mercer.\" (Keep in mind, Im the same guy who once wrote an entire column for his old website in 1998 based around the premise, \"Ron Mercer is Gods gift for taking Reggie Lewis away from us.\" I LOVED Ron Mercer.) Sharp responded \"/gulps /reads Ron mercer stats /blinks repeatedly /stares off into space like Wittman watching this season go down in flames\" while House literally disappeared and was never heard from again until the Wiz won two games.\nBS: I loved everything about this email -- especially how Doc Rivers and Matthew Weiner (\ns creator and showrunner) probably went through the same series of mental steps before casting their sons. \n But for the record, at least Austin Rivers can play solid defense and get through three-minute stretches without killing you. I cant remember ever saying the words, \"Thank God for that Glen Bishop scene.\" Marten Weiner makes Robert Iler look like Daniel Day-Lewis.\n(Hold on, big \"but\" coming ... )\nBUT I can totally identify with Weiner-Rivers syndrome. Youre always going to overrate your own son. Just this week, my 7-year-old son figured out how to rig \n to start goalie fights -- he plays the Kings opponent, repeatedly goes offside and makes runs at Jonathan Quick, and then, when Quick gets upset, he switches controllers and presses the \"Y\" button until Quick is fighting with the other teams goalie. Its the dumbest, most brilliant video-game strategy I have ever witnessed. This is on the heels of him ripping off 25 different WWE finishing moves in three minutes on our hotel bed the morning of \n for a YouTube video that I can never put up because hes not wearing a shirt and Internet creeps scare me.\nIs there a chance my son will be living at home until hes 40? No question. Did you read the previous paragraph? If I had the chance to do whatever my version of \"casting him on my TV show or my NBA team\" would be, Id do it. And no, theres no better example of Weiner-Rivers syndrome than Charles Dolan and Dr. Jerry Buss. \nBS: Supposedly Weiner hates giving away anything in \"scenes from next weeks episode\" montages. You have to love the moxie of someone who zealously protects the secrecy of next weeks episode while also giving away pivotal scenes to his overmatched son. Im gonna miss Matthew Weiner. Great show. Hold on, this paragraph was pretty pedestrian. We need a comedy infusion.\nBS: I never run \n emails in the mailbag, but made an exception here only because (a) you couldnt make this story up, and (b) from everything Ive ever heard or read about the Lopez brothers, theyre the real-life version of the Hanson brothers. So I believe this story and it made me laugh. And yup, these are my readers."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-saturday-decision/", "blog_text": "During Eddie Murphys first \n season, Joe Piscopo started appearing on \"Weekend Update\" as a goofy sports anchor who shouted the big stories in exclamation points. Saturday would have been perfect for him. \n Its looking like an all-time, tell-your-grandkids-about-it-40-years-from-now sports day. May 2, 2015.\nIn \n two weeks ago, you might remember me seeing the NBAs schedule for Round 1 and fretting about one of the all-time sports fan conundrums. If the Clips-Spurs battle miraculously produced a Game 7, that would undoubtedly happen on Saturday night. I already had my ticket for that hypothetical game. But I also had a chance to attend Floyd-Manny, which meant witnessing a once-in-a-generation fight in Vegas with my L.A. buddies. Cant lose either way, right? You never want to make a tough decision until you HAVE to make a tough decision ... and now were here.\nGame 7, Spurs at Clippers: 5 p.m. PT, Los Angeles.\nOr ...\nMayweather-Pacquiao, 8:30 p.m. PT (approximately), Las Vegas.\nPick one.\n(Yikes.)\nHere are the for-and-against cases for Game 7 and The Fight.\n Even before it officially became \"One of Best Round 1 Series Ever,\" we knew it had a chance to broach \"Feels Like The Finals If They Happened In Round 1\" (which is exactly what happened) ... I attended Games 1, 2 and 5 in L.A., and they were more like life experiences than basketball games ... thanks to those quietly dramatic Hack-a-DJ moments, these contests balloon to nearly three hours and feel a little like those Yankees-Red Sox nail-biter marathons from 2003 and 2004 (without 86 years of baggage and eight decades of hammer-versus-nail story lines, but still) ... potentially, the final basketball game ever for one of my favorite non-Celtics ever, The Great Tim Duncan (I think thats officially his name now) ... if the Clips were to lose a Game 7 at home, wed inch even closer to a career scenario with CP3 and Blake that becomes a Hottest of Hot Takes cross between \"The Poor Mans Stockton and Malone\" and \"The Sedin Brothers of Basketball\" ... seeing Kawhi the Sharktopus in person in Game 7 mode (hold this thought) ... Pop Sarcastically Working The Refs vs. Doc Sarcastically Working the Refs in the Game 7 of Sarcastic Reactions ... the biggest game of CP3s life, hands down ... the biggest game of Blakes life, hands down ... its a Legacy Game in every respect.\nWait, theres more! You KNOW Joey Crawford will be there (if youre a Spurs fan: gulp) ... Game 7s are ludicrously tense anyway, but imagine a Game 7 with the home crowd sweating out that ghastly Clips bench twice per half (its like 20,000 Little League parents watching their uncoordinated son settling under a fly ball in right field, but for 10 solid minutes) ... Austin Rivers in a Game 7!!!! ... oh, and it might be the end of \n (or yet another triumph) ... can the Clips remember what they learned in Game 6 (keep your heads down, just play, dont let the refs bother you, keep your poise) and apply it to Game 7? ... can Clippers fans affect the game without coming off like a bunch of whining maniacs who inadvertently work their boys into a whining froth (and vice versa?) ... I could keep going and going, but one thing Ive learned in life is that theres really never a good excuse to miss a Game 7 ... in fact, you can use that for your high school yearbook quote if youre under 18.\n Weve been waiting for Floyd-versus-Manny for six to seven solid years ... its the biggest of Big Fights ... its in Vegas ... that means you get to gamble on the fight AND play blackjack afterward, an appealing scenario for anyone with a gambling problem (not me) or anyone who loves to gamble while repeatedly claiming that they dont have a gambling problem (hey, thats me!) ... Ive been to a couple of Big Fights in my life, and, from a buzz/electricity/eye candy/celebrity/fashion/comedy standpoint, theres simply nothing like them ... just enough people made a solid \"No no no, Manny has a real chance if he can throw punches from every angle for 12 rounds!\" case that Im slightly wavering on my belief that Floyd will whup him handily ... you can still get reasonable odds on either guy (-200 for Floyd, +170 for Manny) ... its a Legacy Fight, obviously ... and seeing Floyd in person, for any reason, is unlike just about anything else ... it can never be forgotten that Messi and Floyd are better at what they do than anyone else is at anything.\nUnfortunately, Floyd also spent the past eight years transforming himself into the real-life Clubber Lang (a villain from central casting, basically), only if Clubber had also been convicted twice of \n. Yeah, Floyd was always a difficult person to like or understand. But a relentless (and deserved) assault by the media and on social media, too, has rendered him so completely unlikable that the unthinkable happened. Within the past two weeks, a groundswell of media members have been imploring everyone to boycott the fight ... and they didnt seem crazy.\nI will not be boycotting the fight for two reasons. First, I have been a boxing fan since I fell in love with Ali during the mid-1970s, back when Alis \n appearances resonated in ways that you couldnt possibly understand 40 years later. We had only like six channels back then. Ali passing through ABCs orbit on a Saturday afternoon trumped anything else that could ever possibly happen on a Saturday afternoon. So I got hooked on boxing at a young age by someone who, truly, was \"The Greatest.\"\nAnd I never regretted it, even after I grew up and realized that boxing employed more \n than every other professional sport combined. Its the only sport where an announcer can say, \"Hes a young 35,\" and thats an understood code for \"He spent a few years in jail.\" Of the top 200 moments in my life when I said to myself, purely as a sports fan, \"I dont know if I feel good about this,\" I think boxing was involved in 185 of them. Were not making the world a better place through boxing; that ship sailed long ago. Remember, the goal of boxing is to repeatedly punch your opponent, either to accumulate points or to knock him unconscious; its one of the most primitive sports we have, and if youre thinking about attaching humanity and morality to it, youre fooling yourself.\nWatching Saturdays fight doesnt mean that you condone Floyds vile behavior. Its apples and oranges. This isnt a sport where you can just pick and choose your viewing based on some arbitrary (but well-intentioned) moral compass. It doesnt exist. Not in boxing. Any serious sports fan has battled that choice for three decades and counting, right around the time Alis abrupt deterioration made tangible a cause-and-effect to what we had watched (and condoned, too). When I was growing up, boxing always mattered. Now it matters in once-a-year spurts. And every time it matters, that spawns a new round of people grappling with the morality of it -- a conversation that feels louder in 2015 because \n is louder in 2015. In the Twitter/Hot Take/Shame Police era, its all about extremes. And thats the thing about boxing -- it was always the nuances that made it so interesting. Some of the finest sportswriting ever tackled those very nuances: like Gay Taleses famous Floyd Patterson feature for \n or Mark Krams unforgettable \n piece on the final (and particularly brutal) Frazier-Ali fight. This isnt an either/or thing. Its complicated. And were not solving it this weekend.\nSecond and more important, whats going to be more entertaining than rooting against Floyd Mayweather? Hes the greatest boxing villain weve had since George Foreman 40 years ago! How can anyone not dislike this guy? We get to root for someone to punch Floyd in the face for 12 rounds? Im supposed to BOYCOTT this? Stop it. Since Floyd is getting his $175 million (or whatever it ends up being) either way, why not find a way to watch the fight and root for Manny? This is 1980 USA vs. USSR crossed with Douglas vs. Tyson in Japan crossed with Balboa vs. Drago in Russia. I wagered on Floyd two months ago (parlaying him and the Cavs to win the East), got swayed by all the anti-Floyd pieces (and they keep coming and coming), and eventually made a second wager on Manny to divest all financial interests. Im rooting for Manny Douglas Balboa Eruzione to ruin Mayweathers undefeated record, upend his legacy and represent the Karma Police against an unusually vile opponent. Boycott? Please.\n I mean, shit. Its Game 7. Even Johnnie Cochran in his prime couldnt make a good case against a Game 7. And it might be Duncans final game, too? And a fork-in-the-road moment for Blake and CP? The only \"case\" I can make against it: Add up Hack-a-DJ plus commercials plus prime-time TV timeouts and this baby could swell past 8 p.m. PT; throw in an unexpected overtime and suddenly youre looking at 8:30 (yeeeesh), and thats without factoring in the Staples Center exit (never easy) and traffic (always there). So, yeah, attend Game 7 and theres a real chance of missing a chunk of the fight (which, based on the history of these fights, probably wont start until 8:45 p.m. PT).\nIf youre watching on TV? Perfect. Game 7 will bleed right into the fight. If youre going to the game? Different story. Whatever time this game ends, Ill be the guy weaving through the postgame crowd like Barry Sanders and driving home like Dom Toretto. Ride or die.\n: Were getting it five solid years too late; its like Bird and Magic finally meeting in the NBA Finals, only if it had happened in 1991 with a slightly past-his-prime Magic taking on a broken-down Bird and his 30-pound back brace. My biggest problem with the timing of this bout: In December 2012, a cartoonishly \n Juan Manuel Marquez -- who had never come close to knocking out Manny in their previous three fights, by the way -- was suddenly throwing frightening haymakers and repeatedly rocking the unrockable Manny. Everything crested with one perfect punch, as Marquez briefly unplugged Mannys brain for nearly two minutes \n He didnt just knock Manny out; we thought Manny was \n.\nNow, there are two schools of thought after something like that happens. Either ...\n1. That knockout (and all the ensuing adversity and doubt) actually made Manny stronger. And it wasnt just the knockout; it was the devastating feeling of knowing that you had let your entire country down. I mean, \n. When he gets knocked out, that whole country gets knocked out. So hes been forced to overcome so much more than the invincible-to-this-point Floyd ever did. He hit rock bottom, questioned himself, answered those questions and rallied back stronger than ever. No different from the Spurs after blowing the 2013 Finals, when they could have imploded and instead used that heartbreak as renewed motivation and determination for the following season. Thats the case for Manny bouncing back. The flip side ...\n2. Youre never the same after you get knocked the F out like that. Youre never the same. Youre NEVER the same.\nHeres where I would love to be wrong: I believe in the second school of thought (not the first, which feels a little too media-created for me). I dont see how having your brain get demolished to the point that it says \"Im shutting down for two solid minutes to regroup\" is ever a good thing. And all the justifiable hatred/poison/disgust/contempt thats being thrown Floyds way, as bizarre as this sounds, might have made Floyd stronger. Hes spent an entire career feeding off haters and rebelling against everything we ever wanted from a champion. He earned so much money that he actually nicknamed himself \"Money.\" He drinks Haterade like its bottled water. He thrives on booing and collective venom, and he loves the sound of a crowd thats slowly giving up because \n.\nBy the time that first bell rings, Floyd will have worked himself into a defiant, me-against-the-world frenzy. Only it wont be a frenzy, because thats not how Floyd works. He uses outside forces to drive himself to a deeper performance level -- improved concentration, deeper resolve, almost like he took Bradley Coopers special pill in \n. He goes to another level beyond the level beyond the level. He reaches the final stage of whatever fucked-up video game this is. He sees blows before theyre coming, bends in ways that shouldnt be humanly possible, throws punches to set up punches that are coming eight punches later. Hes one of the best ever at hitting people while rarely, if ever, getting hit. And when hes locked in, when hes truly locked in, he cannot be beaten. Its just about impossible.\nThe best thing about being there on Saturday night? The chance that Manny might topple THAT.\nThe worst thing about being there? Watching Floyd clinically dismantle Manny and slowly usurp all hope, round after round, as the crowd slowly settles into a disappointed realization that, you know, its watching the greatest fighter of his generation doing his thing, yet again, with all of his unlikable demons and indefensible baggage lingering over everything. If I had to bet my life on any Floyd-Manny scenario, it would be that one.\nWill the fight end up being as special as everyone hopes? Probably not. I hope Im wrong. I hope Manny pulls off a semi-miracle. Yes, I will watch. No, Im not going. I made my choice. Game 7.\nAnd by the way? I didnt have a choice. My daughter turns 10 tomorrow. Shes already a master guilt-tripper and consistently ropes me into doing whatever she wants. Its a dad-daughter thing and its impossible to explain; they just kind of own you from Day 1. Im spending the entire day with her, then going to Game 7 ... and only because she \n me to do so. Yes, Im daughter-whipped.\nI bring this up for a crucial reason: Every May, my daughters birthday party falls on an unbelievable sports day. The Derby, multiple playoff games, at least one Game 7, a big fight ... I mean, year after year, the first Saturday in May becomes one of the three best sports days of the year. And I could have avoided this, year after year, had my wife and I done the math pre-pregnancy and \n (no pun intended) for a better birthday. You know, like first week in March. Or late July. Maybe even the week before Super Bowl Week.\nHeres the point: If youre pulling the goalie and youre a psycho about sports (and there are more of us out there than youd think), dont be afraid to get a little Gladwell/\n/Canadian Hockey Parent Weird and \n for a certain birthday range. You can get a little sports-fan selfish about it. It might work, it might not. But it doesnt have to be a totally random event. Also, we never had this conversation. But thats how I came to pick Game 7 (and my daughter, kind of) over The Big Fight. Time to rip through some NBA emails. As always, these are actual emails from actual readers.\nBS: We needed a way to describe those three-minute stretches when Kawhi shifts into All-Madden mode, grows six extra arms, then starts prowling midcourt like a great white looking for shaky ball handlers who mistakenly swam away from their pack. He does everything but throw a shark fin on his back -- no different from Pippen and MJ abusing terrified ball handlers on the 96 Bulls. (Thats the greatest YouTube montage that nobodys made yet.) But Id rather name the event itself something like \"Sharktopus Mode\" over pushing it as someones nickname. Do you really need a nickname if you already have a unique first name? Kobe, Kyrie, LeBron, Kawhi, Dirk, Steph, Shaq, Kanye, Oprah, Rembert ... whats the point?\nBS: Like the thinking and love that you went cross-sport AND cross-racial for a Curry-Gretzky comparison. Very well done. But man ... Gretzky???\nBS: Now you have me thinking. (And ... Im done.) Cant we just go with Maravich crossed with Nash? Do we have to bring the best hockey forward ever into this? By the time Gretzky turned 27 (Currys age now), hed already won three Cups and eight straight Hart Trophies (EIGHT!!!) and broken every conceivable NHL scoring record. Gretzky was so good that, when someone nicknamed him \"The Great One,\" it actually stuck as his nickname. Do you realize how great you have to be at playing sports to earn and \n a nickname like \"Magic\" or \"The Great One\"? If Curry wins the title, does Maravich/Nash things, topples LeBron and finishes something like 16-3 or 16-4 in the 2015 playoffs, even THEN Im not ready to have this discussion. Lets just say \"Hes a little Gretzky-ish at times\" and be done with it.\nBS: I love this for so many reasons, but mainly because it doesnt presume all-time greatness like \"The Great One,\" \"The Greatest\" or \"Magic.\" Its just pure excitement -- an expletive and exclamation points. And it has a great acronym. S.F.C.! I dont think Steph needs a nickname, but thats pretty good.\n\n\nBS: Not bad. Last Friday, I asked the readers to see if they could top \"Lossie for the Aussie\" or \"Skimmin for Simmons.\" My favorite runner-up suggestions: Blunder for Down Under, Poo for a Kangaroo, Bend Down for Ben, DeRailin for the Australian and Pulled Asunder for Down Under. Here was the meanest suggestion:\nBS: Words hurt. The truth hurts even more. But heres our winner:\nBS: \"B.S. for B.S.!\"\nThats right ... B.S. for \"B.S. for B.S.\"!\nAnyway, Im putting Blunder for Down Under and B.S. for B.S. in the Ben Simmons 2016 Tankapalooza Catchphrase Finals. I need more time to marinate on this. After all, we are talking about a franchise forward with the exact same name as my only son and who just so happens to be entering the same draft lottery in which my favorite team has its own pick, Brooklyns pick (UNPROTECTED!) and Dallass pick (top-seven protected -- and yeah, that team is Year 18 Dirk, Knee Surgery Parsons and Just About Nobody Else right now). This is too important. I need more time.\nAlso in last weeks mailbag, I gave everyone one week to top \"James Dolan, disaster expert\" in a new game called \"Find someone who has the exact same name as a celebrity, but also has a ridiculous job that somehow ties into how ridiculous the celebrity is.\" Of course, nobody could top it because how the hell was anyone ever topping \"James Dolan, disaster expert\"? But I did enjoy these beauties.\n ... \n ... \n ... \n ... \n ... \n ... and \nNow, some might say I cheated by not including the other Bill Simmons -- a.k.a. \"El Wingador,\" the renowned chicken wing eating champion who went to jail for cocaine trafficking. But Ive been in the same room with cocaine only once in my life -- during Game 7, 2004 ALCS, the bathroom of an undisclosed Boston bar, when I had gone in there to pee and inadvertently walked in on two guys snorting lines off the bathroom sink. (In their defense, the Red Sox were trying to come back from 3-0 and there were no laws in Boston that night.) Its true: Lenny Bias blew three to four Celtics titles, but he also ruined any chance of me ever trying cocaine.\nThat raises a separate mailbag question (Ill save you the energy): Would I rather have those three to four titles and maybe four to five extra Bird-McHale years (since Bias would have extended their careers) even if it meant there would have been a good chance Id have at least \n cocaine in college (and then who knows?) ... or would I rather keep things the way they were? And the answer, obviously, is OF COURSE I WOULD HAVE WANTED THE EXTRA TITLES AND THE EXTRA BIRD-MCHALE YEARS!!! ARE YOU CRAZY??????? Oh screw it, Im going to hell anyway.\nBS: Not in Game 6! It was the new and improved, referee-friendly, non-stomping, non-eyeballing, taking-care-of-business CP! Well see if it was an aberration. The Clippers cant beat San Antonio when theyre worried about the refs for three straight hours. Just play basketball, for Gods sake. As a Los Angeles reader named Ryan points out, its not a coincidence that they ended up with someone nicknamed \"Big Baby\" on this team. They blew Game 5 because they lost their poise, rode the refs relentlessly and inspired their formerly-beaten-down-but-endearing fans to do more play-to-play bitching than any crowd Ive ever seen. It was like a basketball whirlpool of excuse-making, sarcastic grinning, disgusted hand-throwing, eyeballing, stomping and yelping. And it really hurt them. You cant do that crap against the Spurs. I want to see the mentally tough Game 6 Clips in Game 7. If the mentally weak Game 5 Clips show up, theyre done.\nBS: Come on, come on. Theyre trying. Game 6 was a big step forward.\nBS: Thats your best-case scenario for Saturday night, right? The Clips leading by three in the final five minutes, then ripping the Spurs to shreds with CP3-Blake screen-and-rolls to finish it off for their first 66-point Scrabble score. For the record, I was crazy jealous of Bobs fantastic Scrabble analogy. So good. Its the eternal dilemma of every NBA contender that has two elite players but cant figure out how to build around them. Even better, its fun to think of different NBA GMs looking at their Scrabble tiles right now.\nBilly King: \"I have all 1-point letters, all the big-score letters are gone, all the blanks are gone, Im down 100 points, and I gave away my next three turns to the Celtics ... but we can do this!!!!!\"\nPhil Jackson: \"Wait ... how many tiles do you get each turn again? And how do the points work? Hold on, where am I?\"\nVlade Divac: \"Vivek, what word do you want me to spell?\"\nSam Presti: \"Everything is fine! Everything is fine! I dont even want to know how many tiles are left, and I dont want to think about the triple-word score that I missed 10 turns ago because I got too cute and tried to set up a use-all-my-tiles 50-pointer and inadvertently screwed it up. Ive gotten the Q, the Z, 4 S tiles and both blanks and I still might lose! Its OK! I can rally! Everything is fine!\"\n\n\nBS: No.\n\n\nBS: Of course! Playoff Wittman: the guy who belatedly embraced things like \"3s over long 2s,\" \"Otto Porters young legs\" and \"Paul Pierce as a stretch 4 opening up the paint for Wall and Beal.\" As my buddy House (a D.C. diehard) says, Regular-Season Wittman plays checkers and Playoff Wittman plays chess. Was Playoff Wittman playing possum for the past six months? Was he hibernating? Did the Internet break him down and coach him up? I just know that a Wiz-Cavs Eastern finals is looking ludicrously realistic. Needless to say, the Wiz own my 2015 playoff heart because of Paul Pierce; its like lending one of your favorite uncles to someone elses holiday dinner table. \nBS: Its not that bad. Hes a 50/50 guy now -- you love 50 percent of the stuff he does and you hate the other 50 percent. How bout the Mavs stiffing Rondo on his 2015 playoff share? Is there a better way to show your contempt for a teammate than stiffing him on his playoff share? I love sports sometimes. I wish ESPN voted on playoff shares every year. I would totall-- AHHHHHHHHHHHHH! IM GETTING ELECTROSHOCKED!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!\nBS: Yup, these are my friends.\nBS: I love everything about this. First, the Undertaker has defied the aging process and extended his prime for reasons that have never really been explained ... kind of like Tim Duncan. Second, the Undertakers 21-0 \n streak was wrestlings equivalent to Duncan being the best big man on Finals winners 15 years apart and/or making All-NBA teams 18 years apart\n and/or averaging 21 and 12 for his first 17 years of playoff games and 16 and 11 in Year 18 of the playoffs. Third, neither of them say much and spend a ton of time looking around with a weird look on their faces. Fourth, Undertaker was the behind-the-scenes leader of WWEs locker room for years and years and was loved by everyone who worked with him (like Duncan with the Spurs). And fifth, if anyone could successfully pull off the NBAs version of \"Just show up for \n and were good,\" wouldnt it be the Spurs?\nOK, so what if Duncan were to retire this summer ... and the Spurs use their available cap space to sign, say, LaMarcus Aldridge ... and then Duncan \"miraculously\" un-retires on April 1 and comes back Undertaker-style for three months? And he just keeps doing this until he turns 45? Theres probably some dumb salary-cap rule that rooster-blocks this idea, but screw it -- lets fix the cap. I WANT 25 YEARS OF UNDERTAKER DUNCAN!!!!!\nBS: Yes and no and yes and no. Yes because its never good for someone to bomb in the playoffs right before he hunts for a max deal; he was like a Bizarro Jerome James. No because Aldridge wasnt leaving Portland unless Round 1 went badly. Yes because that series proved something we already knew: Aldridge is a star, but hes not a superstar. (Youre not a title contender just because he showed up. But in a 2008 Celtics-type scenario, where hes one of three All-Stars, thats different. So youre one-third of the way there with him.) And no because part of me always wonders if, when someone knows theyre probably leaving a franchise, the ensuing guilt inadvertently affects their performance on the way out the door. Think LeBron in 2010. Just a theory. I can only tell you that the Aldridge in that Memphis series didnt totally look like the Aldridge weve been watching these past two seasons. And it had to go a little deeper than \"Z-Bo knows all his moves.\"\nBS: No question whatsoever. I call these players \"Internet Victims\" -- when a steady torrent of abuse inadvertently makes them better and shames them into improving their deficiencies. Your 2014 Internet Victim MVP: Rudy Gay. 2015: James Harden. And 2016: Dame Lillard. Lock it down. Right now, hes a basketball DH.\nBS: Ill do you one better: I will run that email and say, \"Man, Tito Crafts \n.\" Ill throw in italics and everything.\nBS: I mean ...\nBS: Did I get that email about 24 hours before Father Kelly Olynyk ripped Loves shoulder out of its socket? Yes. Yes I did. By the way, Ive been watching Father Kelly for two years; hes a clumsy, uncoordinated, way-too-nice, laid-back Canadian who sucks at boxing out and had just heard his coach scream at his entire team about not giving up offensive rebounds. I believe it was a fluke. Then again, Im the same guy who still believes Bernard Karmell Pollard should serve prison time, so Im probably not an unbiased observer here.\n\n\nBS: Are you kidding? If Love holds any real bitterness, well waive Father Kelly tomorrow! Well strip his clothes, force him to walk from Charlestown to the South End wearing an \"Im sorry, Kevin\" sign. Well get him to cut his haircut just like Kevin Love and become the Damien Mizdow to Loves The Miz. Well turn Father Kelly into Loves personal chef, chauffeur and pot wrangler. Whatever he wants. Father Kelly aint standing between Boston and Kevin Love. The reason he didnt intentionally hurt Love doubles as the reason hes expendable: Again, hes a clumsy, uncoordinated, way-too-nice, laid-back Canadian who sucks at boxing out (and cant protect the rim). Could he become a stretch big off the bench for a contender? Sure! But you dont throw away a chance at Kevin Love for it.\n(You know why I know Love would be good in Brad Stevenss system as a stretch 4 who bangs the boards? Because Jared Sullinger, Gigi Datome and Father Kelly all had their moments in that system ... and hes way way way better than any of them. FORGIVE US, KEVIN LOVE! NO HARD FEELINGS!)\n\n\nBS: And on a Sunday, no less.\nBS: That would be the best ESPYS category ever.\nBS: Im starting to feel bad. Can I cheer the Cleveland fans up for a second? Your team turned Love into a glorified role player. Its LeBrons team and Kyries team -- everyone else either spreads the floor, plays defense, crashes the boards or shoots open 3s. You can lose your THIRD-best player and still win the title. Losing Love means less lineup flexibility, less margin for error, more predictability and more of LeBron at the 4 (playing power guard). It also means more Mike Miller, James Jones and Shawn Marion; along with Kendrick Perkins, they could star in a Costacos Brothers poster called \"The Cleveland Cadaverliers.\" But I still like their crunch-time five -- LeBron, Kyrie, Shumpert, J.R. Smith and either Thompson or Mozgov (depending on matchups). Its not over. Right?\nBS: I give up.\nBS: Yup ... these are my readers."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-tim-duncan-question/", "blog_text": "When my father \n, only a few months before his 62nd birthday, I remember friends and family members being surprised that he didnt stay longer. \"You always want to get out a year early, not one or two years too late,\" my dad always explained.\nAt the time, I thought this was exceptionally astute. Now I realize it was code for \n But at the time? I thought my father was a modern-day Confucius. You always want to get out a year early, not one or two years too late. Its totally true.\nAnd if thats true ... what do we do about Tim Duncan?\nThe NBAs real-life Undertaker just got bounced from the playoffs in an unusually excruciating way, falling two points shy in one of the best Game 7s ever. Maybe Saturdays Clippers defeat wasnt as gut-wrenching as San Antonios improbable 2013 Finals collapse, but Duncans murky future gave Game 7 a different kind of desperation. He scored 27 points, grabbed 11 rebounds, drained two game-tying, uber-clutch free throws with eight seconds to play ... and missed blocking Chris Pauls last-second, double-clutch, series-winning banker by the length of maybe two knuckles.\nTen years ago, he absolutely would have blocked that shot.\nFive years ago, he probably would have blocked it.\nIn May of 2015, at age 39, playing on one leg -- with 18 seasons, 1,572 games and nearly 55,000 minutes on his NBA odometer -- Tim Duncan couldnt quite get there.\nWas that the last play of his career? Duncan isnt saying yet. Of the 14 greatest NBA players ever -- Jordan, then Russell, then Kareem, then Bird and Magic and Duncan and LeBron, then Wilt and Kobe, then West and Oscar, then Hakeem and Shaq and Moses -- 10 of the 14 retired at least one or two years too late.\n As soon as Kobe retires, hell become the 11th. LeBron doesnt count yet. So only the great Bill Russell definitely got out early -- he dropped the mic after winning back-to-back titles and beating Wilt, West AND Elgin. And then he hugged his teammates, sprayed some champagne, gave one of my favorite postgame interviews ever ...\n... and just like that, Bill Russell walked away.\nSo those are the stakes for Tim Duncan. Leave right now. Leave everyone wanting more. Leave people saying, \"Keep playing! Youre still good at this!\" Leave with your legs still working. (Fine, one of your legs.) Leave knowing that, by any calculation, you were one of the best two-way players ever and one of the most beloved teammates ever. Leave with five titles, two MVPs and an astonishing 15 All-NBA team nods.\n Leave as someone who averaged 21 and 12 with 50 percent shooting and a 24.6 PER in 234 playoff games from 1998 through 2014 ... and then 18 and 11 with 59 percent shooting and a 24.0 PER in your final playoff series.\n Leave behind an astoundingly efficient Year 1 through Year 18 stretch that only Kareem and Karl Malone can match. Leave after \n losing a historically great series. Leave after your normally gruff coach \n ...\n\"I continue to be amazed by Tim Duncan. He was our most consistent player in the playoffs, at 39. He needed a little more help and I feel badly he didnt get it. It wasnt for lack of trying. Even our players shake their heads at his performance at both ends of the floor. He wants it badly and does it the right way. Its not about bells and whistles and grunting and dancing and doing commercials and all of that stuff. He just does it quietly and thats why we feel badly when we dont get it done for him.\"\n Eighteen years and theyre still saying this about Timmaaay??? What if hes leaving two years early? What if he has one more vintage beauty in him? Before he decides, I really hope he watches the last 12 minutes and 10 seconds of Game 7 again. Maybe it will get his juices flowing. Heres a retro diary to help fill in the blanks.\n With Chris Paul resting on the bench, the Clips just \"blew\" a four-point lead (three missed 3s, one turnover) and have a foul to give ... Manu Ginobili knows it ... only Austin Rivers doesnt realize that Manu knows it ... leading to the rarely seen \"fouled in the act of shooting a 3 from 65 feet away\" call ... leading to the incredible sight of Rivers and his son executing matching disbelief/sprint/stomp skids.\nDouble Rivers! Its like a Double Rainbow for demonstrative NBA frown fests. Have we peaked with bitching at referees? I think weve peaked. Of course, they were right -- bogus call. But that became my favorite Austin Rivers/Game 7 moment other than one ugly second-quarter miss prompting a grizzled Clips fan in my row to snarl in disgust, \"Jesus, Id rather have Chris on one leg out there than Docs son.\" You know who else felt that way? Doc Rivers! Anyway, Manu makes two of three. And just when you thought San Antonio had the momentum ...\n Paul comes back, dribbles over midcourt, takes three steps (no travel call -- a pseudo-makeup), banks in a 37-footer and immediately stares down referee Monty McCutchen for the NBAs first-ever one-legged, double-clutch, 37-foot F.U. banker. Double Rivers, Double Momentum Swing! For once, an appallingly bad call didnt derail the Clippers, it rerailed them.\n Patty Mills drains a 3 as 18,000 Clips fans inside Staples Center mutter, \n Yet another reason why Duncan should retire: Tony Parker might not be Tony Parker anymore. Check out these playoff numbers ...\n2013: 36.4 mpg, 20.6 ppg, 7.0 apg, 45.8% FG, 5.3 FTA, 21.5 PER\n2014: 31.3 mpg, 17.4 ppg, 4.8 apg, 48.6% FG, 3.0 FTA, 15.8 PER\n2015: 30.0 mpg, 10.9 ppg, 3.6 apg, 36.3% FG, 2.4 FTA, 6.3 PER\nYeeesh. Its hard to run a slash-and-kick offense when your point guard cant slash or kick.\n Even if an Achilles strain hampered Parker, isnt that the problem with aging point guards? Its always something, right? With 1,008 regular-season games and 203 playoff games behind him, how is this situation getting \n? Or could you blame San Antonios grueling 2012-14 run -- Western finals, Finals, Finals -- for Parkers body wearing down? Right now, Duncan is doing laps in some Caribbean pool and asking himself these very questions. (Thinking.) Youre right, hes definitely not thinking about this.\n Three-pointer, Chris Paul. Quick tangent ...\nIn 1976, I was there when a thoroughly banged-up John Havlicek made his famous off-one-leg running banker in the \n. I watched Kevin McHale play on a broken foot for four straight rounds in 87. I watched Larry Legend submit multiple \n moments in 91 and 92 while wearing a disturbingly bulky back brace. I watched a gimpy Wade throw on his Batman costume and help out Superman LeBron in those last two 2013 Finals games. But watching Chris Pauls trial-and-error routine with that faulty hamstring, once he returned to Game 7 Saturday, ranks right up there. He just wouldnt let that thing derail him.\nOne time in the fourth quarter, Paul pushed it too far, instinctively pulled up and grabbed the back of his leg, fought it off and kept hopping around. You could see him shifting into De Niro/\n mode ... \n These guys happen to be otherworldly athletes; thats why we watch. They make our dreams come true. But sometimes, adversity pulls something magical from them -- maybe their body breaks down, maybe they feel the game slipping away, maybe the teams are uneven, whatever. And they just ascend to a different place. You can actually \n it. Its incredible to watch. I have been going to Clippers games for four years; that was easily the best game Ive ever seen Chris Paul play. It was like watching someone win a NASCAR race with three tires. He had no margin for error. None.\nAnd here was the best thing about it: Everyone has to shut the heck up now. Shelve the \"never made the conference finals\" argument. Shelve the \"never came up huge when it mattered\" hot take. Chris Paul just played an all-time game in an all-time series. And won. And it happened on the heels of him submitting the best seven-year stretch in point guard history -- nobody has ever remained this efficient on both ends for this long. Its simply never happened. Hes the best point guard of his generation. Game 7 ended up being his submission to the \"Best Point Guards Ever\" club -- his version of Isiahs slightly-more-incredible Game 6 of the 1988 Finals. A game that I absolutely revere even though a Bad Boy Piston was involved.\nLast point: After seeing how badly CP3 wanted Saturdays game, it was fascinating to watch how badly Floyd and Manny \n want their fight. They made an exceptionally lucrative arrangement to stage a friendly 12-round boxing exhibition, our first-ever Happy To Be There fight of the century. This was the good-natured, hate-free, low-stakes battle that Drago and Creed were supposed to have had.\n When Manny fell behind heading into the last four rounds, you never felt his urgency -- because he didnt have any. That dude had both arms raised from the moment they told him how much money he was making. Game 7 wasnt the best undercard for Floyd and Manny, thats for sure. They made the Williams sisters look like fierce rivals. Anyway ...\n Missed Kawhi 3, Diaw rebound, Manu 3 (good!), Griffin turnover, Spurs fast break ... and Kawhi blows a twisting reverse layup that leads to a Matt Barnes dunk. I didnt love Kawhis last two games -- no-showed Game 6, never went full \n in Game 7. Does he trust his own talent yet? Couldnt he have beaten any Clipper off the dribble whenever he wanted? Why did it seem like he wasnt ready to be The Guy? That series stuck him one notch below the leagues best -- LeBron, Curry, Harden, Westbrook, Durant, Griffin and Paul -- because none of those seven guys would have just one signature A-game in a truly special seven-game series. On the bright side, of everyone I just mentioned, only LeBron and Kawhi have Finals MVPs. I dont have a feel for this one yet. To be continued.\n More back-and-forth action crests with CP3 hitting a jumper, Duncan abusing DeAndre on the low post (hes officially in Game 6 2013 Finals Jedi mode), then Blake pulling off a reverse layup for a three-point play (\"hrrrrrrr-HAHHHHHHHH\"). When its the right Game 7, something of a survival instinct kicks in -- step up your game or else. That happened in the best two Game 7s I ever caught in person: 1981 Boston-Philly and 1987 Boston-Detroit. Everyone just kept climbing the ladder as the fans glanced around in disbelief. This was the exact point in Saturdays game when it started happening -- right here. (Youre gonna miss those moments, Timmay.)\n Kawhi short-arms a jumper but grabs the rebound, leading to another Manu 3. (If this was Manus final game, let the record show that his last two baskets were made 3s.) Then Jamal Crawford throws the ball away and fouls Parker. Let the record show that Crawford scored nine crucial points during the games darkest stretch for Clips fans, which can be described in collective quotes like this ...\n\"Thats weird, why is Chris coming out so soon? Two minutes left in the first quarter? He just made a 3! We dont have a bench!!!! Its Game 7!!!!!!\"\n\"Um ... why did Chris just limp off to the locker room?\"\n\"Im ignoring the next 10 minutes as I text everyone I know and frantically refresh Twitter over and over again.\"\n\"Nice shot, Jamal! WHY ISNT ANYONE TEXTING ME BACK????\"\n\"Ballmer paid $2 billion and he couldnt give us decent Wi-Fi? WHERE IS CHRIS PAUL???\"\n\"OUR SEASON IS GONNA COME DOWN TO DOCS FUCKING SON!!!! OF COURSE! OF COURSE IT IS! THIS IS THE MOST CLIPPERS-Y MOMENT EVER!!!!!!!!!\"\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\"Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring ... \"\n\"Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring Hamstring ... \"\n\"Hey -- theres Chris! Hes back!\n\"Is he ... (holding breath ... )\"\n\"HERE COMES WILLIS!!!!! ER -- CHRIS!!!!!!!! And were only down one!!!!!!\"\nSo yeah, Jamal might have stunk in Round 1 -- 11.7 points, 38 percent shooting, 20 percent from 3 and a ghastly 8.86 PER. But those nine no-CP3 points were nine of the biggest points of his career. The Clips dont win Game 7 without them.\n After misses from Kawhi and Crawford, Danny Green makes a driving layup for a three-point play. Timeout, Clippers. From the 1:51 mark of the third quarter until right now, neither team led by more than TWO points. Thats nearly eight minutes of game time in all. Oh, and the final average score of this series was Spurs 103.4, Clippers 103.0.\n(Translation: Had this been a 49-game series, it would have come down to the last minute of Game 49.)\n Good God, its Hack-A-DJ!!!!!! He makes only one of two. Can you really give DeAndre Jordan a $120 million, five-year extension when hes become such a free throw liability that hes headed for a Game 7 crunch-time benching? Well have to ask this guy ...\n(Youre right, DJ is probably getting that $120 million.)\n Duncan scores and CP3 bricks an 18-footer, leading to the games second Coulda Woulda Shoulda momentum swing play\n -- Parker grabbed the rebound, only he forgot that Chris Paul loves sneak-picking pockets after missed Clippers shots. Whoops. Pop flipped out after this one. Not protecting a big defensive rebound against Chris Paul -- thats like not moving the leftover pork chops far enough away from the counter if you have a dog. Huge mistake. Parker quickly fouls Griffin, who makes both free throws. Coulda woulda shoulda.\n Barnes comes in for DeAndre. Hold this thought.\n Kawhi barely misses another runner in traffic (partly because of splendid defense by Griffin), followed by J.J. Redick finally arriving for Game 7 by nailing a monster 3. (Welcome to the game, J.J.!) We went from \"up five with the ball\" to \"tie game\" in like 10 nanoseconds. Timeout, Spurs.\n Diaw to Duncan inside for a layup, Redicks second straight 3 (off a nice pick from Blake), Parker with an off-balance banker. Boom, boom, boom. Dizzying. Such a high level of hoops. And the subtweet conversation of this epic run ... no DeAndre! Doc willingly sacrificed rim protection and defensive rebounding to spread the floor and avoid the Seventh Circle of Hell (a.k.a. Game 7 Crunch-Time Hack-A-DJ). Say what you want about Doc, but this decision took a set of watermelon-size balls. I loved it.\n Danny Green fouls a driving/careering/fearless Blake and Griffin drains both. Hed finish with a 24-13-10, including 10 of 11 from the charity stripe, in what can only be described as \"A Full Realization Of Everything I Ever Wanted From Blake Griffin.\" He played brilliantly all series, but in the final two games, he put together the mental parts, too. Specifically, \n How many times was Blake gasping for air on the bench like hed just finished a triathlon? Nobody played harder. He finally figured it out.\nGreat power forwards arent that complicated -- once they hit their playoff peaks, they start going for 24 and 12 every night and thats just how it goes. Look up Malone, Barkley, Pettit, Duncan, C-Webb, Garnett, Elgin ... it doesnt matter. Those guys were getting 24 and 12 at their peaks. Blake took it up a notch: For the series, he sent in his 42 Club application by averaging 24, 13 and 7, with a 26.0 PER, which has never been done for an entire NBA postseason. By anyone. \n: Duncan (twice), Garnett (three times), Oscar (once) and Blake so far. And throwing out the stats, Blake just \n in that Game 7. Lost in the celebration of Pauls game-winning shot was a frightening image: Griffin watching the play unfold, taking off from the foul line and launching toward the basket for what would have unquestionably been the greatest and most memorable follow-up dunk of all time ... only the shot went in and Griffins lower half collided with Manu Ginobili ...\n... which nearly broke his neck, but whatever. Blake didnt care what happened to him -- he was dunking that putback even if it killed him. I loved it. Maybe it IS time for Duncan to get out. Like winter in \n, Blake Griffin is coming.\n (And Anthony Davis, too.)\n Diaw misses a 5-footer, Barnes blocks two Green putbacks (TWO!), then Duncan makes a layup AND gets fouled by Griffin, followed by the textbook Duncan/Undertaker dead-eyed shuffle/stomp-away/eye-bulge routine toward the sideline as his bench erupts. Just a stupefyingly competitive sequence that doubles as DeAndres best case for a $120 million extension, even before Duncan misses the free throw, Diaw grabs the rebound (PAY DEANDRE!!!!!), and eventually, Parker gets a wide-open 3 and misses it. And just when Spurs fans feel themselves starting to grumble, \"Put in Patty Mills!!!!\" ...\n Rebound, Kawhi. Putback, Kawhi. Possible Leap brewing?\n Our third Coulda Woulda Shoulda play starts with CP3 missing a jump shot short, then Parker bolting on a fast break with only Redick back. Parker pulls up for a split second ... but its a ploy! Stutter step! Now hes challenging Redick (and why not???) with the patented Parker 5-foot floater ... only it doesnt fall!\nHow did that not go in?\nHow the hell did that not go in???\n(And as Im thinking that, were already going back the other way, and Barnes is open for 3 ... )\n In the words of Mike Breen, \"Bang!!!!!!!!!!\" Not since Robert Horrys heyday has such a statistically shaky, up-and-down, pseudo-journeyman doubled as such a valuable you-can-go-to-war-with-him playoff guy. He made six or seven huge fourth-quarter plays and vindicated Docs decision to bench DeAndre. Of anyone whos ever been married to a real-life reality show character, Barnes is the one youd want in a do-or-die basketball game -- narrowly edging Mauricio from \n.\n Wait, you ordered another breathtakingly crazy sequence? How bout Diaw barely missing a runner, Danny Green stuffing Blakes tomahawk jam (whaaaaaaaat???), Parker missing a twisting layup (Spurs fans might not want to watch this tape for a while), Diaw snaring the rebound and finding a wide-open Green, Green MISSING the semi-dagger 3, then Parker easily putting back Greens miss and getting shoved 5 feet back by Barnes -- no call! Timeout, Clippers.\n\"I do not want this series to end,\" TNTs Kevin Harlan yelps on the broadcast. Heres why this was Coulda Woulda Shoulda Sequence No. 4: The Spurs ended up with two points, not three. Green played well in Game 7 on both ends, but that wide-open 3 hurt them; so did the no-call. By the way ...\nGreen, 2014 playoffs: 49.1% FG, 48% 3FG, 4.4 3FGA, 16.5 PER\nGreen, 2015 playoffs: 34.4% FG, 30% 3FG, 5.7 3FGA, 10.4 PER\n(The only Spurs who played as well in the 2015 playoffs as they did in the 2014 playoffs: Duncan and Mills. Who woulda thunk? Maybe thats one more reason for Duncan to come back -- new blood! Free agents! I wish I could wager on things like \"The Spurs will use a first-rounder to deal Splitters contract, talk Duncan into coming back, sign LaMarcus Aldridge and extend Kawhi. Fake Vegas odds: 5-to-1. Im in for fake $100.)\n Crawford beats Parker with a beautiful running one-hander off a Griffin handoff. Monster shot. Strange but true: Of the 148 players who qualified for the playoff PER leaders after Round 1, five of the top eight Clippers couldnt crack the top 100: Barnes (10.8), Rivers (9.46), Redick (9.44), Crawford (8.86) and Big Baby Davis (7.51, putting him 130 out of 148). I dont know whether to high-five Coach Doc or throw a drink in GM Docs face.\n Kawhi makes a sweet hesitation move, finds the right shot (an open 12-footer) and totally short-arms it. Rebound, Griffin. (No DeAndre -- still!) In the last three second halves of this series, Kawhi shot 3-for-23 and made only one shot that wasnt a layup. Thats why, in Mondays end-of-season press conference, Pop broke down Kawhis development as a future franchise guy by saying, \"Its a matter of understanding that it will be expected night after night after night.\"\nAnd its probably coming. But the Spurs desperately needed Kawhi to kick ass in Game 82, Game 88 and/or Game 89; he wasnt one of the three best players in this series. Even if that next-level leap will eventually come, much like it just came for Blake (three years older), Duncan cant wait around forever. I blame myself for throwing the Apex Scottie comparisons around. Put it this way: 1993 Scottie would have gone after a hobbled CP3 like a cheetah going after a stray gazelle that wanders from the pack. Kawhi isnt all the way there yet. By the time he gets there, Duncan will be gone. Alas.\n The Clips take too long to run their patented Blake/Chris high screen and end up with Blakes panic 18-footer, which quickly turns into Coulda Woulda Shoulda No. 5. Look at this picture ...\nNot only does it seem impossible for the Clips to snare that rebound, Im getting Nam-like flashbacks to LeBrons first brick in Game 6 that nearly decapitated Kawhi before bouncing off 15 guys and \n. And yet, Blakes brick flew hard to the right, away from every Spur and directly at the only Clipper with a chance (Barnes). Timeout, Clippers.\n(This was also the moment when I remember looking around and thinking to myself, \n)\n Monty McCutcheon belatedly calls Duncan for a body foul about 1.3 seconds after CP3 releases his missed jumper. Ludicrous whistle. When they no-called Barness body block on Parker at 1:23, for me, that was our under-the-radar sign that the players would decide this game. Nope. Pop waves in disgust and turns back to his bench, like he was watching a meter maid writing him a ticket, said \"Screw it,\" and left the ticket on his car to get coffee. Go figure -- Team Whine & Cheese got the shakiest big call of Round 1. Had the roles been reversed, they would have had to airlift a purple Doc out of Staples Center.\n(Yes, this was Coulda Woulda Shoulda Play No. 6. And yes, Chris made both free throws -- giving him an astonishing 26 straight for the postseason. Timeout, Spurs.)\n The Spurs run a beauty of a play, getting Duncan rolling to the basket off a switch and forcing Redick to foul him. That means Duncan, hovering at 50 percent for the series, now has to save San Antonios season from the free throw line. In the moment, I found myself rooting for him like he was a Boston guy. \n The crowd was standing and hollering and whooping. It was REALLY loud. Only Duncan regrouped his 39-year-old one-legged body and freaking drained both of them. The Undertaker lives.\nhttps://youtu.be/hpsZYh-DI88\n You look into someones basketball soul in those moments; we already knew what was inside Duncan, but man, those were like a 9.5 out of 10 on the Free Throw Pressure Scale. I actually think DeAndre Jordan would have grazed the shot clock with one of them. Duncan might be a mediocre free throw shooter, but for whatever reason, I trusted him in that moment. Usually, great players figure out how to get shit done. Theres no real stat for it, either -- Im pretty sure nobody gave a \"Great Players Figure Out How To Get Shit Done\" talk at the 2015 Sloan Conference. Sometimes its not about numbers.\n I dont see how the same guy who made THOSE free throws can retire. Hes been the same guy for seven solid years. Freak. Alien. I see no sign of slippage other than the fact that hes got one leg. (Thinking.) Youre right, thats a problem. But I went to four of those seven games and didnt see any laboring. NBA big men and wrestlers age the same way -- they get stiff and lose their balance. Happens to everyone. When I went to \n and watched the actual Undertaker wrestling, guess what? Shaky balance, moved like a half-mummy. \n Our two best Duncan doppelgangers from a body/physique/footwork/talent standpoint: probably Hakeem and Garnett. Happened to them, too. You could see the signs. I never felt that way watching Duncan -- not once.\nNo biggie, just Chris Paul hitting the greatest shot of his life, one of the greatest game winners ever, the greatest shot in Clippers history and the latest series-winning shot ever taken in a Game 7.\nThey played 341 minutes in this series; the Clippers took the lead for good at the 340:59 mark. The Spurs knew what play was coming, and so did the fans, only it didnt matter. Whats amazing is that Paul always seemed to think it was going in. Everyone went bonkers, obviously. I have been in the building for some ear-splitting, everyone-loses-their-shit NBA reactions, ranging from Havliceks aforementioned banker (the triple-OT game) to Bird Steals the Ball to Ray Allens 3 to a slew of others. Really, theres no \"loudest\" sound. Once you reach Everyone Loses Their Shit level, thats it. You cant get higher. To call this the most spectacular game in Clippers history would be like calling \n the most important movie of M. Night Shyamalans career. \n I dont even know if the Clippers had an \nIt was also Coulda Woulda Shoulda No. 7 ... because how the freaking hell did that shot go in??? I cant even come up with another smaller player, in NBA history, who could have made that double-clutch angle with those two guys hounding him. Kyrie??? Maybe. Kevin Johnson? Maybe. CP3 played brilliantly all series, injured himself at the worst possible time, rallied back and ended up making history. And that seven-game series/battle/war/life experience brought that whole team closer together. Dont sleep on the Clippers.\n I hated the shady whoops-the-buzzer-went-off clock fiasco for 120 different reasons, but mainly these four: It was shady as hell; it tipped off Barnes that the play was coming; it led to both Pop and owner Peter Holt serenading the scorekeeper with F-bombs (actually, I loved that);\n and it obscured the fact that Pop called a lousy, low-chance play. As far as shady end-of-the-series moments go, it wasnt even half as ludicrous as Lakers fans storming the court before the 88 Pistons tried their game-tying 3. Whatever.\n Clippers 111, Spurs 109. A.k.a. the Chris Paul game. Like always, the Spurs put over another up-and-coming contender like a longtime wrestling champion would. As a reader named Vince in Lambertville writes, \"Every so often, the Spurs get to hold the title and remind everyone, Were really freaking good. But they dont need to defend the title for everyone to intuitively understand theyre the champs. Their greatest value is actually putting other teams over.\"\nIts so true -- they did it for Dirks Mavericks, Nashs Suns, Z-Bos Grizzlies, Durants Thunder, LeBrons Heat, and now, CP3s Clippers. Adds Vince, \"That series was like a 35-minute WWE classic. All that was left was Duncan standing in the middle of the ring, raising CP3s hand and pointing at him. Im going to miss these guys when theyre not around anymore.\" Me too.\nAnd I dont care if it was Round 1. Thats one of the 12 best seven-game series since 1976s ABA-NBA merger if youre ranking for star power, general story lines, legacy-related story lines, closeness of the games, atmosphere, and iconic games/plays/moments ...\n 1978 Bullets-Sonics, 1980 Sonics-Bucks, 1981 Sixers-Bucks, 1988 Mavs-Lakers, 1990 Blazers-Spurs, 1992 Bulls-Knicks, 1993 Suns-Sonics, 1994 Suns-Rockets, 1995 Magic-Pacers, 2000 Knicks-Heat, 2000 Lakers-Blazers, 2004 Kings-Wolves, 2009 Celts-Bulls (lost its \"Best Round 1 Series Ever\" belt), 2010 Celts-Lakers, 2012 Celts-Heat.\n 1979 Bullets-Spurs (Ice blows a 3-1 lead), 1981 Sixers-Celtics (the championship belt holder), 1984 Celts-Lakers (four iconic games!), 1987 Bucks-Celtics (best second-rounder ever),\n 1987 Celts-Pistons (insane), 1988 Lakers-Pistons (doubly insane), 1995 Pacers-Knicks (Reggie vs. Ewing), 1998 Pacers-Bulls (MJ taken to the brink), 2002 Lakers-Kings (the NBA goes WWE), 2006 Mavs-Spurs (the lost great 21st-century series), 2013 Heat-Spurs (a life experience) and 2015 Spurs-Clips. Thats an unassailable list.\nAnd thanks to the NBAs primitive playoff setup and San Antonios uncharacteristic Game 82 stumble in New Orleans, two of the NBAs four best teams ended up clashing in Round 1. Total fluke. The Spurs blew Game 6 at home, couldnt put Game 7 away and lost when a great player made an even greater shot. Either that was the best possible way for Duncan to go out (with a bang, still playing well) or the worst possible way (because it was, to borrow a poker term, something of an unlucky beat). Only he knows.\nThe night ended with the Spurs partying in Los Angeles, because why not? Theyre the unofficial champs even when theyre not the champs. In a classic twist, Aron Baynes was overserved and none other than Tim Duncan carried poor Baynes to the teams bus. Of course, \n. They looked like the real-life version of Kevin Costner carrying John C. Reilly to his room at the end of \n. Tim Duncan, the ultimate teammate. Always.\n\nSo ... should Duncan retire? If it feels like a sports movie moment, thats because its basically the plot in \n, everyones favorite baseball movie thats locked in the basement of a reprehensible romance drama. Like everyone else, I devour the baseball scenes and hate-watch the Kelly Preston scenes. I love watching Billy Chapel (Costner) go for the perfect game while muttering to himself like a lunatic. I love the \"I love you, Mickey Hart!\" scene. I love Vin Scully. I love Costners buddy on the other team who sold out and joined the Yankees. I love watching John C. Reilly pretending to be a catcher. I love the moment when Costner realizes he has a perfect game going. I love Vern Schillinger Whiplash Simmons as Costners manager. I love \"Clear the mechanism.\"\nAnd I really love one particular moment, right near the end, when Chapel realizes that everything hurts too much. That he doesnt want to pitch for anyone else. That hes too expensive to keep but too stubborn to switch teams. Everything just falls into place for him during that game. He doesnt want to pitch anymore. He wants to leave on a high. And in the best scene of the movie, he fights off the tears in the dugout, scribbles something on a baseball and sends it up to the teams president with the game still unfolding.\n\"Tell them Im through -- For love of the game, Billy Chapel.\"\nAlways gets me. Well, couldnt you see Duncan leaving that way next month? No press conference, no fanfare, no farewell tour, no exit interviews. Just \n How does someone even reach that point? Nineteen out of 20 times in basketball, a legends body makes the choice for him: Bird, Magic, Jordan, Shaq, Hakeem, Barkley, Malone, Elgin ... you can keep going and going. But that 20th time, thats when it gets complicated. Now its a mental thing. When you know its time to go, its not about the games, the locker rooms, the camaraderie, the charter planes and the salaries anymore. All of that stuff makes you want to keep playing, actually.\nBut \n to play -- thats the culprit.\nIts the mental burden that saps you. You start missing your freedom. You have to eat a certain way, sleep a certain way, prepare a certain way. You learn to dread those mornings after back-to-backs. You hate those early wakeup calls, hate being at the gym for hours by yourself, hate working on things that you already learned a million years ago. You already peaked, and you know it, so its all about killing yourself so you can be 70 percent as good as you once were. You have young dudes coming at you left and right, always looking to prove themselves, doing anything possible to put themselves on the map against you. Shit, you could see it with Blake Griffin in Round 1. He didnt just want to win, he wanted to take it to Duncan. Again and again and again.\nSo its not about one more year. Its about 18 of them, and how they add up and start subtracting from the current product.\nCould the Spurs have beaten the Clips with a healthier Parker? Will free agency help? Will Kawhi make The Leap? Could Duncan have blocked that CP3 shot? Did he get there in time? Was he a split second late? Did his brain see it coming, completely and totally, only his body couldnt quite get there?\nI bet Duncan is asking himself all of these things. He will disappear this summer, like he always does, and he will remain in shape by swimming and eating plants and doing whatever else aliens do. Some time before July 1, he will share his plan with the Spurs. Only Duncan knows if it will be one year too early. I just know that hes one of the best basketball players I have ever seen. I hope he comes back. And I hope he doesnt come back."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/the-playoff-gambling-suggestion-box/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/nfl-lessons-learned/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/that-championship-mailbag-2/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/the-dr-v-story-a-letter-from-the-editor/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/the-super-bag/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/approaching-the-finish-line/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/bill-simmons-breaks-down-the-2014-worst-nba-contracts/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/the-trade-deadline-diary/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-nba-bag-volume-1", "blog_text": "\n\nSG: Youre on!\n\n\nSG: You cant stick Thibs in Minnesota and have him try to get Nikola Pekovic and Kevin Martin to play defense. Thats un-American. The Thibs laughing GIF will become his full-time personality until hes institutionalized.\nAnyway, heres the best case for keeping Love: We just watched what happened in Portland, when Unhappy LaMarcus Aldridge turned into Happy LaMarcus Aldridge as soon as the Blazers started winning.\nOn the other hand, Minnesota hasnt shown Love anything for six years other than \"Were a complete mess behind the scenes,\" \"Congratulations, youre the new KG circa 2005\" and \"If you want to go down as the best player who never played in a playoff game, you should definitely stay here.\"\nI think they have to trade him. Only four trades make sense. Any Love trade should happen before Junes draft -- one year before Love can opt out of his contract -- and it cant happen without his wink-wink consent. For instance, you cant trade him to Detroit for Andre Drummond and draft picks; he wouldnt want a front-office situation thats just as screwy as the one in Minnesota. But you could trade him to these four places:\n\nI gotta admit, the thought of Love playing run-and-gun in Jeff Hornaceks entertaining offense with Dragic and Bledsoe is downright titillating. But this would be the ultimate quarters-and-dimes-for-a-two-dollar-bill trade: something like Alex Len (last years no. 5 pick), three 2014 first-rounders (from Indy, Washington and Phoenix, all top-12 protected at least) and a protected Minnesota first-rounder that Phoenix already owns (thanks, David Kahn!) for Love and J.J. Bareas Expiring-in-2015 Contract. Thats about 60 cents on the dollar since theres no lottery pick in the deal other than Len ... and he might be the Ukrainian Meyers Leonard for all we know. I am lukecold. \n\nLove went to UCLA, dates an actress, lives here during the summers, the whole thing. If theres a smart way to get him here, hes coming. Cross the Clippers off for now because theyd never trade Blake Griffin when hes playing this well. The Lakers? Thats far-fetched since they have no trade assets, no present and no future beyond \"We have a lottery pick!\" and \"People love playing here!\" Only one scenario works: a three-teamer in which Memphis gets Pau Gasol (sign-and-trade to reunite the Gasol \n), Minnesota gets Zach Randolph (expires in 2015) and L.A.s unprotected lottery picks in 2014 and 2017, and the Lakers get Love. Thats 80 cents on the dollar, especially if that Lakers pick falls in the 3-to-5 range.\nProblem No. 1: Its too hard to pull off three-teamers. Problem No. 2: If Im the Lakers, Id rather keep my 2014 pick and cross my fingers that I can sign Love in 2015 (and his Olympics buddy Kevin Durant one year later). Problem No. 3: Because of the Stepien Rule, the Lakers cant trade that 2014 pick right away because they already traded away their 2015 pick (to Phoenix). Theyd have to make the 2014 pick, sign that player, THEN trade him. (Highly unrealistic.) And Problem No. 4: If youre Love, why trade one mess for another? Why not wait a year? Dont worry, Lakers fans, the NBA is rigging the 2014 lottery for you. Youll be fine. \n\nHmmmm ... what about Taj Gibson, Charlottes 2014 first-rounder, their own 2014 first-rounder and the rights to Nikola Mirotic for Love? Even without a lottery pick, thats 75 cents on the dollar for Minnesota. And if Chicago made the deal AND amnestied Carlos Boozer, then assuming the cap goes up next season, itd have enough cap space left to throw at someone like Lance Stephenson or ... (wait for it) ... Luol Deng! INTRIGUING! Noah, Love, Rose, Butler and Deng/Lance? Here come the Bulls!\nThe problem: Theres no sexy piece in that trade for Minnesota. How do you sell that baby to your fans? \"We replaced our franchise player with two non-lottery picks well definitely screw up, an unknown foreigner and Taj Gibson! GET YOUR SEASON TICKETS NOW!\" I cant see it happening unless Loves agent, Jeff Schwartz, makes it clear that theyre only OKing a trade to Chicago.\n\nLike Love in Minnesota, Rondo can leave Boston in July 2015. And like Love, you cant trade him unless its a team that (a) has assets to give back, and (b) could entice him into staying. Harder than you think. Houston and Dallas dont have the assets. New York DEFINITELY doesnt have the assets. A \"Rondo to Sacramento for Isaiah Thomas, Ben McLemore, Derrick Williamss expiring and the right for Boston to swap picks once in 2014, 2015 or 2016\" deal makes sense on paper -- and was seriously discussed last week, too -- until everyone remembered that youd have a better chance of seeing Rondo host an ABC late-night talk show of him playing Connect Four with celebrities called \n than you would of seeing him spend the rest of his prime, five years, in Sacramento with Boogie Cousins.\nSo, what do you do? Well, arent you better off keeping Rondo -- one of the leagues 15 to 20 best players when healthy -- and finding him an All-Star teammate? Enter Kevin Love. They did it in 2007 with Paul Pierce and they could easily do it again: by paying a premium price for a second All-Star, suddenly it becomes MUCH easier to get that third All-Star. The Celtics couldnt have convinced KG to play with just Pierce ... but Ray Allen and Paul Pierce? The rest was history.\nOK, so what happens if Boston throws its shamrock-shaped Asset Penis on the table and trumps everybody? Lets say the Celtics lose the 2014 lottery and end up with a pick between no. 3 and no. 5. They could send that pick to Minny along with Atlantas first-rounder (probably ending up in the 13-to-18 range) and their 2015 Clippers pick for Love. And they could throw in Brandon Bass and Keith Boganss immediately waivable deal to make the contracts work. Oh, and if Minnesota were more interested in one or more of those future Brooklyn picks that Boston owns (unprotected in 2016 and 2018, pick swap in 2017), the Celts could discuss that, too. Remember, they have a WAR CHEST of picks: 10 in five years, including Brooklyns draft right as theyre entering the \"Deron and Joe are old and Brook Lopez wears a suit to every game\" phase of the Prokhorov era. You team up Love and Rondo and suddenly its 10 times easier to land that third All-Star. (You reading, Carmelo?) And yes, that deal could potentially net the Timberwolves three top-15 picks in a monster draft. \nThe big picture: If Love is loyal to a fault, hell stay in Minnesota. If he wants to jump to the Lakers, he should wait a year, anyway. If he wants to play in a big market and contend for a title, Chicago makes sense ... unless he thinks Derrick Rose will never be the same. But if this were a poker table, the Celtics would have the biggest stack of chips right now. If any current NBA player appreciates stuff like \"Celtic Pride,\" \"Thats a great organization that looks out for its dudes\" and \"wearing the same jersey that Russell and Bird wore,\" its Kevin Love.\nMy best guess: I think Love rides it out in Minnesota, then jumps to the Lakers in 2015. But I wouldnt rule out the Celtics. Dont say I didnt warn you.\n\n\nSG: You know whats amazing about that one? That was an atrocious decision at the time ... \n Now that Rubio has established himself as the worst shooter in modern NBA history, it has to go down as David Kahns single worst decision. Yeah, even worse than taking two straight point guards in 2009 without making sure either of them was named \"Stephen Curry.\" What an abominable talent evaluation. Did anyone other than Kahn, at any point in the past three years, believe that Ricky Rubio had a higher ceiling as an NBA player than Kevin Love? Its staggering. For old times sake ...\n\n\nSG: Nope. Willie still has the trophy -- he and Tony Delk mail it back and forth every three months. And Ross will have a much better career than Willie. But Ross did earn himself pole position in this years \"\n\" award race, which raises the question ... shouldnt we be able to vote on things like this seasons \"Best In-Game Dunk,\" \"Greatest Regular-Season Game\" and \"Craziest WTF Box Score\" just like we vote on the MVP and Rookie of the Year?\nOff that same idea: Why doesnt the NBA have an awards night? What is it waiting for? Throw it two nights before the draft in New York. Why not? Even if it leads to one wonky trade between two drunk owners or GMs, it will be worth it. Think of the groupies! Think of the outfits! Think of the paternity suits! Also, what chain of events would have to happen for Kevin Hart NOT to host the NBA Awards? And what are the odds hed tell a joke that would lead to Shaquille ONeal being slumped over the guy next to him for three minutes straight? If I had one dumb wish for 2014 other than the Lakers inexplicably making Kobes contract twice as long, it would be for the NBA Awards to happen.\n\n\nSG: \"Welcome back to the 2014 NBA Awards. Our next two presenters have something in common -- she always stays in the shot, and he nearly shot someone. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kate Upton and Gilbert Arenas!\"\n\n\nSG: You left out one part of the KGDC-made-a-play arsenal -- teammates flocking to congratulate him with semi-surprised, semi-insulting \"I cant believe you just did that, we were just talking in the locker room yesterday about how little you give a shit!\" looks on their faces. I always enjoy that part.\nSpeaking of Jermaine, there were four NBA certainties heading toward the 2014 trade deadline: (1) The Cavs would forget to deal Anderson Varejao before he got hurt (happened); (2) the Knicks would somehow make their fans deeply, profoundly unhappy (happened); (3) OKC would cheap out at the deadline, then pretend afterward that it tried to do something but it fell through (happened); and (4) the Warriors would pass on getting a backup big man because Jermaine ONeal duped them into thinking they didnt need one, only to watch him get injured within two weeks of the deadline passing (about to happen).\n\n\nSG: Um ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSG: How did you leave out \"Every 20-rebound game from Andre Drummond\"? And where was \"Every near-triple-double by Victor Oladipo\"? By the way, you dont need to give Grant a jab to the kidney -- not after Adrian Wojnarowski \n. How many times do you think Grant typed an angry email to Woj that included the lines, \"How can you not mention that I fleeced the Clips for the pick that led to Kyrie Irving? WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST ME?\" before deciding not to send it? Ten? Twenty? Thirty?\n\n\nSG: Im demanding it. People running the video screens for the other 28 teams -- lets get this done. You see Heat fans or Thunder fans at your arena in good seats, you throw them on the Bandwagon Cam during a timeout. Just do it. It will be a bigger hit than the Kiss Cam. (Thinking.) Actually, nothing will ever be a bigger hit than the Kiss Cam. ABC should just stop launching new shows and broadcast the Kiss Cam in prime time for 10 hours a week. What would you rather watch -- a \n, or the Kiss Cam?\n\n\nSG: It might not even be by default. I have high hopes for the Silver era -- huge basketball fan, smart thinker, not afraid to take chances, not afraid to think outside the box. The NBA definitely got a little stale these last few years. Adam wont be afraid to innovate. (Dont hold it against him that he went to Duke. I know its hard.) A good example: Mark Cubans \n that \"I think hes taken some great steps on the officiating. Theres been more changes in 15 days, or whatever it is, than I saw in 14 years.\" Praise from Mark Cuban! Were in good hands here.\n\n\nSG: Could this be Todd writing the email???? I screwed up ... I totally forgot that Rasheed Wallace was the least likable Celtic of all time, and that \n. In my defense, I blocked that out of my mind because we had to play Rasheed 35 minutes in Game 7 of the 2010 Finals after Perkins went down. And this was at a point in Rasheeds career when you wouldnt have wanted to count on him to walk slowly on a sidewalk for 35 minutes, much less play 35 minutes in a do-or-die basketball game. If I ever wrote a running retro diary of this game, the last paragraph would be me hopping into my car, driving to Staples Center and ramming my car into the Kareem statue at 110 mph.\nAnyway, Todd Day didnt pass or play defense, he showed up teammates on the court, hed gun for his own stats no matter what the situation was, and he made the mistake of tying Larry Legends \"most points in a quarter\" record in 1995. This was also post-Reggie Lewis, post-Big Three, post-Boston Garden, and after M.L. Carr had ruined our salary cap, when the Celts seemed screwed for the rest of the decade and Todd Day symbolized everything that was going to hell. So it wasnt totally his fault. More bad timing than anything. My least favorite Celtics ever were Sheed, then Day, Vin Baker, Curtis Rowe, Sidney Wicks, Fred Roberts, Mark Blount and Jermaine ONeal in some order. Speaking of Sidney ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSG: Im worried that he dropped off too much this season. Wickss career was a thing of beauty -- either a testament to somebody getting paid too much too soon, an indictment of someone literally losing the capacity to give a shit, a road map for how cocaine use steadily climbed in the 1970s, a perfectly designed algorithm for basketball decline, or all four of those things at once. Its amazing.\n71-72 ppg: 24.5\n\n72-73 ppg: 23.8\n\n73-74 ppg: 22.5\n\n74-75 ppg: 21.7\n\n75-76 ppg: 19.1\n\n76-77 ppg: 15.1\n\n77-78 ppg: 13.4\n\n78-79 ppg: 9.8\n\n79-80 ppg: 7.1\n\n80-81 ppg: 6.7\n\n\nSG: \"What if I told you that one awkward dance moment with Kevin Bacon and Sean Penns brother would lead to an NBA revolution? ESPN Films presents, a 30 for 30 film, \n -- directed by Joel and Ethan Coen.\"\n\n\nSG: I see what you did there. By the way, I am hearing that the Knicks considered signing Collins for two solid weeks -- even checking with some of their players for their thoughts -- before backing off because they worried about Collins bringing an even bigger spotlight to their already-melting-under-the-spotlight team. As always, you can count on the Knicks to do the wrong thing.\n\n\nSG: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. James Dolan!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imHYLF7E7oU\n\n\nSG: Welcome to the Jimmer Bandwagon, Adam from Foxborough! Can I get you a doughnut or a soda? Its just us two right now. I couldnt agree more -- Jimmer in MSG almost feels scripted. Look, Ive been on the record for three years: At some point, Jimmer is going to find the right team, hes going to be unleashed, and the rest will be history. Its going to happen. Either hell become a quality Heat Check Guy off the bench for a contender, or hell be drop 23 a night for a lousy team a la Dana Barros on the 94 Sixers. But hes going to have a moment. We WILL have Jimmer Time. You wait.\n\n\nSG: Are you kidding? The Knicks cant even figure out how to use their amnesty! Theyre going to suddenly be smart enough to frame a player to get him off the cap? Id say the odds are 16-to-1. Hey, who wants to look at Ray Feltons suddenly ironic 2013-14 shot chart with me?\n\n\nSG: Since its the NBA, Im going with \"every player is the most likely.\" But Im glad you brought this up. Lord knows Ive made enough \"God Hates Cleveland\" jokes, but if the Cavs are making a crazy playoff push during that final week, can you imagine \n right before the 82nd game?\nStephen A: I dont care what the girl said, I dont care how well the Cleveland Cavaliers happen to be playing right now ... YOU CANNOT PROMISE SEX ACTS AS COMPENSATION FOR AN ACCOMPLISHED DEED, that is absolutely ILLEGAL! That is prostitution, Skip! The Cleveland Cavaliers CANNOT CASH IN THAT OFFER! I do not CARE if she made it, I do not CARE if she wants to deliver it, I do not CARE if she wants to keep it DISCREET! That offer has to go by the wayside. Adam Silver CANNOT allow those shenanigans in the National Basketball Association.\nSkip: Im gonna go the other way, Stephen A.\nStephen: No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSkip: Lemme finish!\nStephen: No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSkip: Lemme finish!\nStephen: No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSkip: Lemme finish!\nStephen: No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSkip: Lemme finish!\nStephen: No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSkip: Lemme finish!\nStephen: No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSkip: Lemme finish!\nStephen: No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSkip: Lemme finish!\nStephen: No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSkip: Lemme finish!\nStephen: No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSkip: Lemme finish, please.\nStephen: Go ahead.\nSkip: An offer was made. Terms were set. The Cavaliers are close to achieving those terms.\nStephen: No! NO, SKIP! NO!\nSkip: Ava Devine is a consenting adult. The Cavaliers are consenting adults.\nStephen: Not Anthony Bennett!\nSkip: Hes 20!\nStephen: HE CANT DRINK YET!\nSkip: Hes 20, and if he wants to have sex with Ava Devine, you cant stop him and neither can I!\n(QUICK CUT TO THE TEST PATTERN.)\n\n\nSG: Im gonna defend KD on this one -- we caught him at 9:30 a.m., right after he had played a late-night game against the Lakers (and dropped 43 points), then flew a red-eye and slept for less than two hours. He was just grumpy. It happens. Normally hes a fun interview. With that said, if we wanted to extend Matts analogy just for shits and giggles, then Durants Sonics year was definitely Mother Love Bone, the first OKC year was Mookie Blaylock, the second OKC year was the name change to Pearl Jam (when the band finally knew what it was), Year 4 was the \n album (when everything took off), Year 5 was the NBA Finals/\n magazine cover, Year 6 was \n (great follow-up album, some tension/discord/injuries), and now were slowly morphing into \n (greatness crossed with weariness and a general longing just to do great work without all the other bullshit that comes with it). Oh, and never forget.\n\n\nSG: Well be back on \n after these brief messages!\n(Dammit! I lost the dare! Oh well, might as well keep going now.)\nI gotta say -- I love Thunder fans. And they spend money on their team -- according to \n, Oklahoma City has the \n right now -- which makes it even sadder when OKC cheaps out and its loyal fans just accept it. That they continue to defend the indefensible Harden trade and email me every time Jeremy Lamb or Steven Adams looks good while overlooking things like \"We could have just waited a year and traded Harden last summer\" or \"We cheaped out at the 2014 trade deadline as always and three days later we had 39-year-old Derek Fisher trying to defend a red-hot Jamal Crawford in crunch time on national TV\" makes them genuinely endearing. At least for me. I hope my kids will always love me as unconditionally as much as Thunder fans love the Thunder.\nHeres a fun game: \"How One-Sided Would the Trade Have to Be for a Thunder Fan to Turn on Their Team?\"\nFor instance, lets say they lost the 2014 Finals and traded Durant to Phoenix for the Morris twins, Channing Frye and three first-round picks, then told their fans, \"This will make us better and deeper long-term\" ... would the Thunder fans get mad?\nWhat if you removed all three first-round picks and it was just Durant for the Morris twins and Frye, along with $3 million cash and 40 second-round picks through 2055? Would that push them over the edge and piss them off?\nWhat about just Durant straight up for Channing Frye? Theyd definitely get mad at that, right? Id love to know where the line is. Because its clearly not \"We broke up a possible dynasty and replaced the best 2-guard in basketball with a backup shooting guard, an energy guy off the bench, a non-lottery pick and one year of Kevin Martin.\"\n\n\nSG: Yup, these are my readers.\n(By the way, Im about 200 words over. I need to work on this whole word-count thing.)"}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nba-bag-volume-2-10-steps-to-tanking-perfection/", "blog_text": "SG: The short answer ... YES!\nYou know how Lance Armstrong was the greatest cheater ever? How he blended his commendable charity work with state-of-the-art science and relentless lying to pull an ongoing Jedi mind trick on the American public? The 2013-14 Sixers have a chance to go down as the greatest NBA self-sabotagers ever. They havent been tanking games as much as obliterating any chance of winning them. And theyre doing it because the NBA gives every team the same loophole ...\nThe Sixers know theyre better off bottoming out in the grisliest way possible, so theyre owning it -- theyve done everything short of signing Kevin Hart and Allen Iversons mom to 10-day contracts. And those moves might be coming next week. Would anything shock you? Look at the self-sabotage blueprint that Phillys new owners and GM Sam Hinkie have followed.\nAnd that was a GREAT trade: Jrue Holiday for 2013s no. 6 pick (Nerlens Noel) and New Orleanss top-five protected first-rounder in 2014. Thanks to New Orleanss struggles, Philly has an excellent chance of landing two top-10 picks in a deep 2014 draft; more important, they improved their own 2014 lottery chances by turning 82 games of Holiday into zero games of the already-injured Noel. A crucial part of self-sabotage: maiming yourself in the short term. You dont want to sorta suck or kinda suck in the NBA. You want to suck all kinds of suck.\n(Important note: I loved that trade last summer and love it even more now that New Orleans is flopping in the West. Philly got somewhere between 130 and 200 cents on the dollar, depending on where that second pick lands, for someone who wasnt a franchise player. I love Rajon Rondo, but if the Celtics got a Holiday-like offer for him, Id be packing his bags and his leather Connect Four case for him.)\nWhats the point of signing veterans like Jarrett Jack, Carl Landry, and Shaun Livingston in July just because you have the extra money? So they can tie up your cap, give you depth, make you a few wins better, take young players under their wing and maybe even teach them good work habits and professional behavior and all that overrated stuff? Screw that! Fill your bench with unproven young guys, failed draft picks and fringe bodies who make you say things like, \"Wait, wasnt that the dude on Jimmers BYU team who got suspended for getting laid?\" and, \"Is that the same Jarvis Varnado who was on Miami, or is this another Jarvis Varnado?\"\nPhilly started out 5-4 for two reasons: Michael Carter-Williams was better than everyone expected, and its three holdovers (Thad Young, Evan Turner and Spencer Hawes) clicked in a surprisingly entertaining way. The Sixers handled it perfectly -- never celebrating, never improving their roster and allowing Young-Turner-Hawes to be thrown in every conceivable trade rumor without ever saying, \"We kinda like what we have here ... change of plans!\" By January, Carter-Williams was developing poor habits and learning to lose. Young was asking for a trade. And Hawes was mailing in games and carrying himself like the star of a hostage video. Well played, Philly.\nBefore the deadline, Philly gave away Turner, Hawes and Lavoy Allen for three second-round picks, two expiring contracts they immediately bought out (Danny Granger and Earl Clark) and the immortal Henry Sims. People get carried away with second-round picks because theyre cost-effective assets if you nail them, but recent history says you have about a 10 percent chance of landing a rotation player from picks 31 to 40. (Since 2009, only Draymond Green, Kyle Singler, Chandler Parsons, Lance Stephenson, DeJuan Blair and MAYBE Nate Wolters came through.) After that, youd have a better chance of hearing someone say the words, \"I think what James Dolan is doing is really smart ... \" By stockpiling second-rounders (five in all), Philly gave itself a punchers chance of landing someone who, someday, might be 80 percent as good as Spencer Hawes. Congratulations! But thats a self-sabotage staple -- youre not throwing games, just making it impossible to win. Hawes and Turner needed to go.\nPhilly gift-wrapped Turner and Allen for Larry Legend for 10 cents on the dollar. Then, the Sixers bought out Granger to save $500K over keeping his sign-and-trade rights and hoping one of the leagues most respected veterans affected Carter-Williams in a positive way. Granger signed with the Clippers, meaning Philly potentially improved two of the leagues five best teams. (Note: I still think Granger has a salad fork sticking out of his back. We will see.) If someone made those two moves in your fantasy league, it would ignite a 125-email chain that included snarky insults, obscenities in all caps and semi-threats like, \"Why dont you drive over to my office right now and say that to my face?\" When the Sixers do it? Totally fine. The NBA enables this behavior -- theres no trade committee, no \"spirit of the league\" rule, nothing. So, why not?\nThanks to a Latvian reader named Reinis for pointing this out: Byron Mullens is really the Olivia Pope of NBA self-sabotage. First, he has the experience -- Mullens was the LVP of that unforgettably wretched 7-59 Bobcats team. When Charlotte dropped 23 straight to end its 2012 saboteurium, Lord Byron was giving them 27.2 horrendous minutes a night. The man knows what hes doing. Nice guy? Absolutely. Could he be your 12th man? Sure! But if youre riding him for big minutes, youre riding a center who doesnt protect the rim, rebound, defend or draw a double-team. Youre riding a sabermetic eyesore. Youre riding a 3-point specialist who cant actually make 3-pointers.\nBelieve me, if youre throwing away your season, you want Byron Mullens involved. Even with the Clips pushing to dump Mullens to open up a roster spot, \n He ended up fetching one fewer second-round pick than Spencer Hawes did! Has there ever been a better self-sabotage move? It was like the 1987 Lakers landing Mychal Thompson, only the exact opposite.\nHeres an interesting blueprint dilemma for Philly -- only Carter-Williams can cost them a couple of losses (by playing too well), but the Sixers want MCW to win Rookie of the Year so that SOMETHING good comes out of this season. You know, because voters are dying to reward the best guy on a team that just lost 36 straight. Lets send him a trophy and a car! Well done, my friend!\nThe case for not shelving Williams with a bogus injury: He feeds into the self-sabotage as long as hes forcing too many plays and cheating for steals over actually playing defense. Have you watched him lately? Yikes. Thats what happens when you enable an impressionable kid and allow him to chase the Rookie of the Year award over trying to win games. Anyway, you could make a strong case for keeping MCW out there. Hold this thought, were coming back to it in Step 10.\nTwo sentences are your buddies here: \"We think he has potential, and we want to see what we have here,\" and, \"We want to get a little more creative with our lineups and see if anything works.\" Both are unequivocal lies. Whatever. If the Celtics landed Kevin Durant in 2007, do you think Boston fans would care seven years later that we played Allan Ray too much, or that Young Gerald Green had the green light to shoot from any spot on the floor, or that we played two and three point guards together at the same time? Again, \n This actually happened. Within a few months, we had KG and Ray Allen and nobody cared. Sixers fans wont care in six months, either. Assuming there are still Sixers fans. That reminds me ...\nWhoops -- the Sixers went the opposite way! My bad. Before Allen Iversons jersey retirement ceremony last weekend, they enticed fans to buy 2014-15 season tickets with a thrilling offer: Get your tickets now and you can have your picture taken in front of Iversons no. 3 banner, then \n Iverson will autograph that photo at a later date. They even called it \n You mean, more exclusive than paying full price for a D-League team with a genuine chance to finish zero for its last 36? Maybe they could have Tony Wroten autograph an \"exclusive\" picture of a disgustingly clogged toilet to commemorate their 29-point home shellacking to Cleveland last month.\n(The good news: The Sixers still have time to rectify this mistake. What about giving your loyal peeps a sorry-about-everything discount for 2015, you dumbasses? Or would that make too much sense?)\nPhilly has a solid chance of passing Milwaukee for the Quadruple P (Ping-Pong Pole Position). The Sixers are only one loss behind, with no plans of ever winning again. But they shouldnt ruin Carter-Williams to do it. In 1997, I watched M.L. Carr irrevocably alter Antoine Walkers career with that same \"Rookie of the Year on a Crap Team\" carrot. As the Celtics threw away their last two months for Duncan ping-pong balls, they had Antoine playing out of position at center, hogging the ball, chasing his own numbers and learning horrendous habits. At the time, I was living in Boston and hitting most of those games because my dad steadfastly refused to go. Trust me: Antoine was only 20 years old, and he NEVER recovered from those two months. He learned all the wrong things. All of them.\nWell, the same thing is happening to Carter-Williams right now. He might be special, he might never get there ... who knows? Hes a fantastic athlete with size, and someone who quickly adapted to the speed of the NBA game and \n from day one. Could he have the career that we always wanted Shaun Livingston to have -- just a slew of 22-9-12s on a series of entertaining teams? Of course. But hes also a genuinely dreadful outside shooter (see Kirk Goldsberrys shot chart below), and hes a little older than you think (at 22, hes actually five months older than Kyrie Irving). We learned this the hard way with poor Ricky Rubio: Sometimes your outside shot is broken, and thats just the way it is.\nRegardless, heres an undeniable fact: Carter-Williams played much better in 2013 (8-11 record, 17.8 PPG, 7.5 APG, 5.5 RPG, 3.1 SPG, 41% FG, 31% 3FG) than he has played in 2014 as the team has gone into self-sabotage mode (6-24 record, 16.5 PPG, 5.4 APG, 5.3 RPG, 1.3 SPG, 38% FG, 24% 3FG). Thats a problem. Theyre better off punting on Rookie of the Year, coming up with a bogus injury and keeping him away from the teams festering stink. There are no good lessons from intentionally getting your asses kicked every night.\nLast night, the Sixers lost by 33 in Oklahoma City as Russell Westbrook finished with a triple-double in 20 minutes. Twenty minutes! Um, how is that helping Carter-Williams? Phillys easiest remaining games: Utah, @Knicks, Sacramento, Knicks, Detroit, @Atlanta, @Boston, Boston, Game 82 at Miami (against Miamis second string). Youre damned right 0-36 is in play.\nMeanwhile, Milwaukee, Utah and Orlando are their self-sabotage partners, although they havent been quite as blatant (ironically, the bumbling Bucks actually TRIED to be good). Utah, Sacramento, Boston and the Lakers will start to smell a little gamey soon. The disappointing Pelicans want to keep that top-five-protected pick, which means (a) get ready for the bogus Anthony Davis injury soon, and (b) we might be getting a lot of Austin Rivers down the stretch. Maybe even 40 minutes a night. We might have to stick paramedics near Haralabob Voulgaris at all times. (What a shame that we cant watch Rivers and Mullens on the same team running pick-and-rolls.) And dont sleep on Atlanta throwing its season away (already happening) or Denver doing the same (about to happen). Ladies and gentlemen, thats our biggest Tankapalooza field ever: one-third of the league!\nDoes Adam Silver care? Does he want to repair this? Ive already suggested fixes in 2007 (the \n), 2009 (in an exchange with Gladwell on \n) and 2011 (tweak on \n). Grantlands Zach Lowe wrote about Mike Zarrens \n three months ago. I mean, if the NBA has a relocation committee and a media rights committee, wouldnt it make sense to create a For the Good of the Game committee? We have too many teams (thats never changing), a season thats too long (that could easily be fixed) and far too much incentive for non-contenders to intentionally fail (that can DEFINITELY be fixed). We also dont have any penalties in place -- not even something as simple as, \"If you lose 90 percent of your games for any 35-game stretch during a season, your season-ticket holders receive a 30 percent discount for the following season.\" Would we see as much self-sabotage if the owners wallets were involved? Somehow I doubt it.\n, I wondered about the best way for an NBA general manager to make sure he stays employed for four to five years. \"The answer: Blow everything up, bottom out, build around young players/cap space/lottery picks, make a bunch of first-round picks, and sell the illusion of hope to your fans. Id like to see people in other professions try this.\"\nAs a San Francisco reader named Aziz pointed out, I inadvertently \"described the private equity business model. Take over a bloated company, load it up with debt, dump assets, cut research & development, and basically guarantee the company cant do anything innovative for a decade. Once the debt is paid off, you have a company with nice free cash flow (cap space). And guess what? Many NBA teams are now owned by private equity or venture capital investors, including some of our most unapologetic tankers.\" One of them? Phillys Josh Harris. Hmmmmmm. Could there be a correlation? And why would the NBA want any correlation?\nThe leagues creative paralysis from 2008 through 2013 had a built-in excuse: David Stern stayed five years too long. He only allowed innovation that involved the words \"digital\" or \"international.\" He stopped taking chances, stopped thinking outside the box, stopped trying to grow the game domestically. He bristled anytime someone questioned him, held on to petty grudges, bullied people behind the scenes and protected the wrong people.\nStern executed his own kind of blueprint: the Heres What Happens When You Stay Too Long blueprint. Even his \"retirement\" lasted an absurdly long time: nearly 18 months in all, as Stern chased and conquered Pete Rozelles meaningless \"longest tenure by a commissioner\" record. He should have exited last June -- after an incredible Finals and a bizarrely entertaining draft in Brooklyn -- in what could have been something of a victory lap. Instead, he hung around for eight more awkward months. Everyone assumed that Stern would stay as the leagues unofficial international ambassador, feasting on a cushy gig that allowed him to traipse around the world (India, China, Australia -- you name it), while pushing the sport abroad. That job never materialized. The dirty secret of Sterns last 18 months was that, as much as the 30 owners respected him, they also believed it was time for him to leave. And somehow, the smartest guy in the room was the last guy who realized it.\nAdam Silvers first month in charge was distinguished mostly by how hastily Silver distanced himself from his old mentor. Many of Sterns administrative cronies had already been forced out, and Sterns surprising absence from All-Star Weekend in New Orleans wasnt exactly random. A new generation has emerged behind the scenes, with Silver flanked by new assistant commish Mark Tatum (a beloved hire), NBA Entertainment honcho Danny Meiseles, merchandising guru Sal LaRocca, global media head Bill Koenig, and Adams right-hand man, Jarad Franzreb, among others. The current group of owners with the most influence -- ranging from the old guard (Peter Holt and the Reinsdorfs) to the newer old guard (Stan Kroenke, James Dolan, Wyc Grousbeck, Mark Cuban, Ted Leonsis) to the new guys (Vivek Ranadive, Joe Lacob) -- all believe in Silver and have his back, both publicly and privately. They like the guy. Thats not a sentence you heard about David Stern very often.\nTruth be told, Stern would have stayed in office even longer if some of those owners hadnt gently nudged him out. With a monster television deal coming, digital content booming and live events becoming the most valuable media rights property -- especially with multiple 24-hour sports networks and local cable superstations that need hundreds of hours of airtime to fill -- the league itself has never been stronger. It didnt just win the last collective bargaining agreement; it \n the players and checkmated a fractured union. Do you realize that Brian McCann signed for more guaranteed money this winter than LeBrons last contract? Its no accident that, other than maybe Milwaukee, ZERO professional basketball teams are for sale. Seattle has two billionaires willing to double the sticker price for a handful of the 30 teams; nobody is biting. Throw in LeBron and Durant -- the best rivalry, potentially, since Bird and Magic -- and all the other star-studded contenders, and its an amazing time to run a basketball league.\nSilver and his owners believe that theres a real window here -- thanks to the concussion crisis in football and the execrable length of baseball games -- for the NBA to seize the reins and become Americas new pastime. Theres a reason the new commish mentioned this publicly more than once. His owners want to hear a little less about \"growing the sport abroad\" and a little more about \"building the sport domestically.\" Other than the way he treated people and carried himself, that was their single biggest issue with Stern.\nAnd thats why this tanking bullshit matters. When 36 percent of your league is willfully throwing away the last five weeks of an 82-game season, youre doing something wrong. Stern stuck his head in the sand. He pretended self-sabotage wasnt a recurring danger, just like he pretended the broken officiating system was fine ... and the always-disappointing All-Star Saturday was fine ... and the annoying 2-3-2 Finals format was fine ... and the stunning lack of minority league executives at every CBA bargaining table was fine ... and the embarrassing Chris Paul trade veto was fine ... and The Decision was fine ... and the Maloofs destroying basketball in Sacramento to the point that the fans had to revolt was fine ... and Clay Bennett extorting Seattle for a new arena and ultimately hijacking the team was fine ... and the league owning the New Orleans franchise as it landed the no. 1 overall pick was fine ... and starting off Silvers commissioner transition by hovering over him for an extra eight months was fine.\nI dont think Adam Silver wants to stick his head in the sand. I really dont. But conquering the self-sabotage corner is a good place for him to start. This isnt tanking. Nobody is throwing games. Theyre just shitting on them. And theyre doing it because its the smartest thing to do. Dont pretend this is fine. Its not."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nba-bag-the-phil-jackson-to-the-knicks-theory/", "blog_text": "SG: Bad start. Dammit.\n\n\nSG: I swear this wont be a Knicks-only mailbag. But since were here, allow me to unveil my theory for everything thats happening with Phil Jackson.\nSo, heres a 68-year-old guy with 13 rings. Hes one of the greatest coaches of all time, only he doesnt want any part of the week-to-week grind of coaching. He was attached to Seattles run at the Kings last year, and would have fetched an ownership stake and control of basketball decisions had Sacramento not fended them off. Detroits Tom Gores has tried to rope Jackson into coming aboard multiple times. A group trying to purchase the Bucks is pushing to get him involved. Its not like he isnt talking to people.\nAfter the Seattle gig vanished, Phil hoped to stay with the Lakers somehow. Hes engaged to the daughter of the late, great Jerry Buss, only her bumbling brother is running the franchise into the ground; that same brother is irrationally threatened by his much smarter, infinitely more basketball-savvy, undeniably condescending future brother-in-law. Jackson needed to figure out how to pressure Jimmy Buss -- a.k.a. Jimmy Boy -- into giving him control of the Lakers and/or a lavish consulting gag.\nWhat happens next? He starts talking to Brooklyn about becoming a high-priced consultant and/or Billy Kings eventual replacement if Brooklyn bombs in Round 1. Famous music manager Irving Azoff (an A-list power broker) catches wind and alerts his embattled buddy James Dolan. \n he tells him. \n Dolan and Jackson start talking. Initially, Phil starts asking for crazy, outlandish stuff and makes a spirited run for the coaching spot of the Keep Getting Dem Checks All-Stars.\nAnd to his amazement a| Dolan keeps saying yes. To everything.\nNow, Jacksons wheels start turning. Could he turn things around in New York? What would this do for his legacy? He knows they dont have first-round picks in 2014 and 2016, but theyll have a slew of cap space once Amare-Bargnani-Chandler come off the books in 2015. He knows he can pull the Zen Master routine on Carmelo and talk him into staying. He knows superstar free agents like Durant, Westbrook and Love are coming down the pike. He knows theres a punchers chance at LeBron. He knows he could manipulate these free agents just like Riley manipulated the Miami guys -- play up the \"mecca of basketball\" thing; play up the history; play up MSG; play up the Biggest City in the World thing; play up the five generations of Knicks fans; play up the whole \"if you win an NBA title here, that will mean more than anyone winning a title anywhere else\" thing; go full-fledged Zen Master on them.\nAnd as he keeps thinking about it, hes inadvertently talking himself into it. He knows Dolan is a horror show of a boss 90 percent of the time, but he also knows about Dolans unwavering loyalty to Isiah Thomas and Donnie Walsh -- when youre in with Dolan, youre in all the way. So he leverages the Knicks by using the threat of the Nets and Lakers. And Dolan just keeps saying \"Yes.\" He even gets Bill Bradley to start lobbying Jackson, which resonates with Jackson much more than Dolan realizes. And at some point, Jackson says to himself, \nThe elephant in the room: Why would anyone think Phil Jackson a 69 in September, and not exactly known for his tireless work ethic during his last few Lakers years a is suddenly ready to outwork the Sam Prestis and Daryl Moreys and Rob Hennigans of the world? Could you see Phil hopping puddle jumpers from Kansas City to Oklahoma City in mid-January to scout lottery picks? What makes the 2014-16 Knicks situation any different from the 2008-10 Knicks situation a| when they wasted two years chasing a pipe dream, came away with $100 million of Amare Stoudemire, then spent hundreds of millions more so they could win exactly one playoff series?\nAlso, doesnt it mean something that the Knicks have been a mess from the moment Dolan took over? Is he the Dan Snyder of basketball, or is Snyder the Dolan of football? Why go near it? Would YOU want to work for James Dolan? How many times does a pipe dream actually work out? And can you really run a team from 3,000 miles away?\nPhil Jackson is grappling with all of these questions. Theres a reason the Knicks deal hasnt been signed or announced: Either hes waiting for Mikhail Prokhorov to trump the offer because Phil ultimately doesnt want to work for Dolan, or hes waiting for his brother-in-law to be to say, \"Dont go to New York, stay here, Ill give you final say over Mitch.\" And when the Jimmys and Mutant Russian Ted Stepien are involved in the same negotiating drama, its probably not going seamlessly, anyway. Right?\nAnyway, thats my theory. I know Im right about the Seattle/Detroit/Milwaukee stuff and the Brooklyn/Azoff stuff, and I believe everything else is right, too. If he takes the Knicks job, Id break down the motivation percentages like this: 50 percent shameless money grab/irresistible \n offer; 20 percent competitiveness/legacy grab; 20 percent affection for/appreciation of the Knicks brand; 10 percent missing the limelight/being relevant again. Personally, I am 17 times more than dubious that a 68-year-old guy with no front-office experience whatsoever can save the Knicks from 3,000 miles away a| while working for James Dolan, no less. Sounds like a recipe for disaster even if youre the Zen Master. We will see.\n\n\nSG: Shots fired at Josh Kroenke! For the record, Im not giving up on Josh yet -- can one family really own the Nuggets, Avalanche, Rams AND Arsenal at the same time? Four teams in four leagues in three different cities and two different countries? Thats ludicrous. I cant put Josh even close to that Buss-Dolan-Maloof level yet. But to answer Garys question, my son definitely fits that legacy-kid profile -- \n, hes a huge pro wrestling fan with no concept of money whos on pace to live at home until hes 40. I think we have a new editor-in-chief for 2042! I cant wait until he reinvents Grantland around slideshows.\n\n\nSG: I really hope thats a photo of Joe D. overpaying Charlie Villanueva and Ben Gordon at the exact same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSG: First of all, words hurt. Second of all, the East was definitely going to be atrocious, so I thought one \"lottery team\" might swerve the other way and improbably sneak into the playoffs. The five possibilities: Milwaukee, Philly, Boston, Toronto and Charlotte. I just backed the wrong team -- the Charlotte Hornbobnetcats would have been an even more ridiculous pick, and theyre headed for a 7-seed. Technically, my logic was sound! \n (13:15 mark) a|\n\"I think the Bucks are going to be a 7-seed with a chance to be a 6-seed if the Knicks totally self-combust.\"\nI was halfway there! I had it! You just switch \"Bobcats\" with \"Bucks\" and Im right there! Of course a|\n\n\nSG: Theres your WTF case for my Bucks/playoff pick. I backed THAT franchise. Poor Owen sounds like he needs some cheering up.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrXOEcyB-A8\n\n\nSG: They cant amnesty Rose because the Bulls signed that deal after the new CBA went into effect. But Roses situation reached \"elephant in the room\" status the moment Chicago unexpectedly resurrected its playoff hopes around Taj Gibson (making a mini leap), D.J. Augustin (super-belatedly looking like a lottery pick) and especially Joakim Noah (a first-team All-NBA candidate who suddenly turned into Bill Walton circa 1977). With multiple Ewing Theory Committee scouts attending their games, every Bulls fan suddenly feels guilty about loving this team so much. And thats before you broach Roses sobering potential to be this generations Penny Hardaway.\nBasically, Bulls fans are in a glass case of emotion right now. Here, look. Watch what happened when I forwarded Sams admittedly ridiculous email to Grantlands Rafe Bartholomew (our staff provocateur) and Robert Mays (our staff Bulls fan).\n\n\nSG: I dont mess around with lower-back issues, herniated discs, surgically repaired knees, legs that arent the same size, slow-healing stress fractures or phrases like \"getting a second opinion\" when Im thinking about taking a big guy first overall. History just says, \"Run the other way! RUN!!!!!\" We also watched Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker emerge as real contenders for the top spot, and everyone loves Dante Exum even if we dont know if hes Australian Penny Hardaway or Australian Larry Hughes. I bet Embiid returns to Kansas next season. That reminds me ...\n\n\nSG: I like it! Thats the biggest obstacle to Adam Silvers desire for an under-20 age limit for the draft -- every powerful agent despises that idea because it delays the \n contract by one year. If Jabari leaves Duke this summer, hed sign his max extension in 2018 and the contract would officially start in the 2018-19 season. If he doesnt leave until 2015, that timetable gets pushed back to 2019 (extension) and the 2019-20 season (when it kicks in). Thats why youll see Jabari Parker awkwardly putting on a Jazz/Sixers/Celtics/Lakers/Bucks cap and hugging Adam Silver on June 26, 2014. Its not about the first contract; its about the second one.\nId suggest this tweak: five-year rookie deals for one-and-done guys and under-20-year-olds; four-year rookie deals for two-and-done guys and 20-year-olds; and three-year rookie deals for everyone else. That would give prospects a real incentive to stay in school, right? Sadly, Silver cant discuss this idea (or any draft-related tweaks) with the National Basketball Players Association because theres nobody running it right now. Billy Hunter didnt just run that thing into the ground; he packed it with explosives and detonated 60 years of history. Nobody seems to care. By the way? Im not sure Silver and the owners care, either -- they say publicly how its frustrating not to have anyone to negotiate with, but really, everything gets to stay the same for them as long as the players union is fractured. Right now, its an owner-friendly CBA. Theyre raking in money. I dont see the age limit thing changing any time soon.\n\n\nSG: Durant by a hair. Hes playing for a 1-seed and averaging a 32-8-6 with 51-40-87 shooting splits and a 30.3 PER. Its one of the greatest non-MJ/non-Wilt offensive seasons ever. This is NOT a 1993 Barkley/MJ or 1997 Malone/MJ situation -- Durant is a better all-around player than Barkley and Malone, and LeBron isnt quite MJ (its true). And yet, LeBron could absolutely pass him with a monster finish.\nQuick aside: I love MVP races and even devoted an entire chapter to them in my basketball book. One of my dopier proposals: that the weight of the MVP trophy should vary depending on the impressiveness of the MVP season. So if Derrick Roses 2011 MVP was a 10-pound trophy, then Shaqs 2000 MVP or MJs 1996 MVP were 40-pounders. I mention this only because you rarely see head-to-head 40-pound trophy seasons battling for the same MVP. Thats what makes this one of the best MVP seasons ever -- its right up there with 1962, 1987, 1990 and 1993. And thats why LeBron vs. Durant is better than every other 2014 regular-season story line except for \n\n\nSG: Its a two-part idea a|\n\nEveryone else gets thrown into a single-elimination, 16-team tournament (my old Entertaining As Hell Tournament idea) as the 14 playoff teams rest up. Your final two EAHT teams get 8-seeds, then play a \"championship\" game. The stakes? The winner gets the choice of which no. 1 seed to play in Round 1, as well as lottery eligibility for that years draft.\n\nWere returning to the late 1980s model -- 14 lottery teams plus our EAHT winner get 1-in-15 odds for the no. 1 pick, 1-in-14 odds for no. 2, 1-in-13 odds for no. 3, and 1-in-12 odds for no. 4. After that, every subsequent pick goes by record (worst team picks fifth, etc). Would the 2014 Sixers commit self-sabotage if the end result was \"Youll embarrass yourself at the EAHT, and youre only guaranteeing yourself no better than the no. 5 pick\"? Maybe not.\nLast point (and Ive made it before): Its not the worst thing ever if a decent team wins the lottery. Was it bad when the Bulls got Derrick Rose, or the Magic teamed up Shaq and Penny Hardaway? If youre making the case \"Dont we have the right to protect certain bumbling franchises from being stuck at the bottom year after year?\" a I mean, isnt that their own fault?\nHeres an idea: If you want to avoid the bottom, make better picks, make smarter trades and spend your cap money wisely. Minnesota had four top-six picks in three years and ended up with Jonny Flynn, Ricky Rubio, Wes Johnson and Derrick Williams. Sacramento had the no. 4, no. 5, no. 7, no. 5 and no. 7 picks in the past five drafts and has only DeMarcus Cousins and Ben McLemore left. The Wizards earned the no. 5, no. 1, no. 6, no. 3 and no. 3 picks in the last five drafts and batted 40 percent on moves. The Cavs had the no. 1, no. 4, no. 4 and no. 1 picks in the past four drafts and cant make the 2014 playoffs.\nIve joked before about being an NBA Republican, but seriously, why enable these losers? If you cant produce a winning franchise, sell it to someone else. The league needs to stop protecting teams from themselves -- we give them amnesties to make up for boneheaded roster moves, luxury tax money to reward them for being cheap, and better lottery odds to make up for being dumbasses. We need more of a \n mind-set. Sink or swim. If theres a way to steal soccers relegation system -- the top 26 teams stay in the league, the bottom four get relegated -- Im all for it. Could you \"add\" five European teams, beef up the D-League so its made up of five loaded D-League teams, then create a separate 14-team league that operates like a poor mans NBA? Its not the craziest idea in the world, right?\n\n\nSG: Right now! Yesterday! Dont you realize that Detroit loses its lottery pick unless it can drop into the top eight? Wheres John Green? PAGING JOHN GREEN!!!!!!!!\n\n\nSG: Thanks for ruining the last two hours of my life -- I just went down a \n to come up with dumb phrases like \"Tragic for Magic,\" \"Unworthy for Worthy\" and \"P.U.-ing for Ewing.\" Your historical winner: Joe Smith in 1995 a| thats right, \"Shitty for Smitty.\" Unbeatable.\n\n\nSG: And on cue a| they lose to OKC last night! I still like this Rockets team. Dwight looks like 88 percent of the old Dwight. Harden nudged himself into the MVP Not Named Durant or LeBron race with his recent offensive explosion; I even saw him play defense two or three times. Chandler Parsons is gunning for a title, a new contract and the chance to redeem \n franchise after Juan Pablo nearly ruined it. Patrick \"Red Bull\" Beverley inspired a \n with me, Andrew Sharp and Chris Ryan just yesterday. Their supporting cast (Terrence Jones, Omer Asik, Jeremy Lin, etc.) isnt terrible. Even if Houston fans might never get over losing out on Jeremy Lamb, Steven Adams and a non-lottery pick to be determined this decade, Houston could beat any Western contender in a series. You know a| unless they peaked too soon.\nLets go to a Speed Round just for the hell of it.\n\n\nSG: Yes a Dirks 2011 Finals MVP.\n\n\nSG: I mean, even I switched to \"YouTubed\" at this point. And Im the same guy with a BlackBerry and AOL.\n\n\nSG: $75 million per year. \n\n\nSG: Still a little too soon.\n\n\nSG: And hes doing it with two phones!\n\n\nSG: You cannot.\n\n\nSG: Lavish?\n\n\nSG: Only for the first three quarters, and only for half-court shots.\n\n\nSG: Lets see one Kevin Love team finish over .500 before we compare him to the leagues no. 3 MVP choice and breakout superstar.\n\n\nSG: The Blowtime Lakers. Come on, thats a layup.\n\n\nSG: Julius Erving for any NBA game or Philly sporting event; Glenn Frey anywhere else. The Eagles sold more than 150 million records and were/are one of the five best-selling concert bands ever. So you have to go with Frey. Regardless, I like any question that allows me to link to one of \n Ive written AND one of \n Ive done! SPEED ROUND IS OVER!\n\n\nSG: Hes actually still alive. I Googled it and everything. Hes played a whopping 254 minutes this season! Since 1990, only three top-three picks have played less than 500 minutes as rookies: Greg Oden (missed the year because of knee surgery), Darko Milicic (played 159 minutes for Detroit) and Otto Porter. To put that in perspective, Kwame Brown, Pervis Ellison and Hasheem Thabeet all passed the 800-minute mark as rookies. Even Anthony Bennett played 647 minutes before recently going down with a knee (h/t Al Michaels). On the other hand, anytime you can spend the third overall pick on a third-string small forward, you have to do it. I ask you again: Why do we insist on enabling dumb teams?\n\n\nSG: So youre saying this 2011 commercial campaign lost a little luster for you?\nMy four follow-up questions a|\n Could you put absolutely anything with \"Coming Home\" and get everyones goose bumps going? Im convinced that J Cole and Skylar Grey intentionally made the intro of that song 30 seconds long so commercials would use it. Im also convinced that ABCs \n did big ratings on Sunday solely because they used it. That song works. Maybe ABCs Paul Lee can save his job by using \"Coming Home\" to promote every ABC show -- even the sitcoms.\n Has any song with the possible exception of Eminems \"Not Afraid\" landed on YouTube for more reasons? If you search for it, \"Coming Home\" comes up for anything and everything: \n, \n (whoops), \n, \n, a \n, \n, the \n, \n, \n (gotta say, I loved this one), \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n (???), and best of all, \n (I might have gotten a little choked up, I cant lie).\n What would be the single most inappropriate montage subject for \"Coming Home\"? Probably O.J. Simpson getting released from prison and returning to Brentwood, right? And why arent there more \"Coming Home\" parodies? Should this \n really be the best one right now? Couldnt someone just dub the song over \n until we come up with a better idea?\n Part of me wants to fake my own ESPN firing so we can make a \"Coming Home\" video for my eventual return. I might do that anyway. Hell, I might do that for next weeks mailbag. You think that would be weird? Well a|\n\n\nSG: At least Im not as weird as Jeremy Gurstel!

If only for Dads sake. The following teams have their own picks: Milwaukee (no. 1, with the highest odds to win the lottery), Philly (2), Orlando (3), Boston (4 - LETS DO THIS!!!!!), Utah (5), L.A. Lakers (6), Cleveland (9), Phoenix (14), Chicago (19), Toronto (20), Memphis (21), Houston (25), L.A. Clippers (26), Miami (27), OKC (28) and San Antonio (30). The other 15 teams either traded their picks or traded protected versions of those picks. Were putting those trades in one place because, for whatever reason, this hasnt been done well enough yet. FYI, I dumbed down the trade details as much as possible.\n Last June, Philly sent Jrue Holiday to New Orleans for Nerlens Noel, a top-five protected 2014 pick and a nine-month loss of dignity (expires April 16).\n Like everyone else with an IQ over 80, \n, writing that \"David Simon might have to revolve an entire \n season around the Cans botching this summer. Er, the Pels.\" If New Orleans never did anything last July, itd have a top-10 lottery pick, Noel, whatever late first-rounder it fetched at the deadline for Robin Lopez, Ryan Anderson, craploads of cap space except for Eric Gordons salbatross ... oh, and theyd have the NBAs third-best asset (21-year-old superfreak Anthony Davis).\nInstead, they have Davis, Holiday, Anderson, no pick and no cap space. Thats a waste of the Brow! Theyre wasting the Brow! Why not make it top-10 protected? Why????\n Right now, New Orleans is losing the no. 11 overall pick. Thats bad if Gary Harris becomes the steal of the lottery for Philly ... and not so bad if the Sixers take Doug McBuckets and he turns into the rich mans Matt Bonner.\n The Cans looked tanktastic until Davis ripped off this outlandish six-game streak ... 42.3 MPG, 32.3 PPG, 14.3 RPG, 58% FG, 87% FT (and four wins). Good luck tanking games with a superfreak on your team, New Orleans. Theyre losing this pick and they know it. You gotta love the Cans -- they trade Chris Paul for 12 cents on the dollar and acquire Holiday for 150 cents on the dollar, they sign Tyreke Evans for 250 cents on the dollar, they spend a top-10 lottery pick on Austin Rivers, and yet, none of it matters because they won the Anthony Davis lottery and hes gonna be an all-timer. The NBA ... where getting rewarded for repeatedly shooting yourself in the foot happens.\n In 2012, Detroit sent the last two years of Ben Gordons contract and a future first-rounder (protected 1-8 in 2014) to Charlotte for Corey Maggettes expiring contract. Seems like a money dump, right? Lets go back a little further ...\n In 2008, Joe Dumars traded a still-in-his-prime Chauncey Billups for Allen Iversons expiring deal. The following summer, Dumars used Iversons cap space to spend $95.7 million on Gordon and Charlie Villanueva. In 2012, Dumars used that aforementioned future protected pick to dump Gordons deal for Maggettes expiring. The following summer, Dumars used Maggettes cap space to spend $78 million on Josh Smith and Brandon Jennings, then cheaped out on any quality coach who could have reined them in. Hold on, I have the Dumbass Police calling Dumars from two different phones.\n Right now, the Pistons are \"battling\" Cleveland for the no. 8 lottery spot -- \n. If they land at no. 9, Charlotte gets it. If they get to no. 8, Detroit keeps it and it rolls over to 2015 (top-one protected) or 2016 (unprotected). If you were a Charlotte fan, do you want the pick now, or would you rather roll the dice with the Detroit Dumbasses bottoming out in 2015 or 2016? Tough dilemma, right?\n Super-duper high for Detroit. Maybe the Pistons should re-sign Gordon for the last few weeks to re-poison the locker room, just to bring everything full circle. Or they could go with Plan B: asking Smith and Brandon Jennings to attempt a never-ending slew of ill-advised 3s and long 2s every game. Oh wait, theyre doing that anyway? My bad.\n In 2011, Denver sent Carmelo Anthony and Chauncey Billups to New York for Wilson Chandler, Danilo Gallinari, Timofey Mozgov, Raymond Felton, an unprotected 2014 pick, a 2016 pick swap and three boxes of JD & the Straight Shots new CD, \n In a 2012 four-teamer, Orlando lost Dwight Howard and basically gained Arron Afflalo, Moe Harkless, Nic Vucevic, the inferior Denver/New York pick (in 2014), and a lifetime reprieve from Dwights farts on the team plane.\n Orlandos Howard deal continues to look glorious. Especially the no-more-farting part. And Im still a defender of the Melo trade, but the Knicks not throwing top-10 protection on that 2014 pick? Pretty dumb. Was it one of the 20 dumbest things James Dolan OKd since he took over in 1999? No. Of course not. But it was pretty dumb.\n Right now, Denver gets no. 10 (from New York), Orlando gets no. 12 (from Denver), and New York gets a situation so dire that it just panic-splurged $60 million on a 68-year-old GM whos never done the job before, might commute from California, hasnt been around the league for three solid years and is already openly admitting things like, \n Sounds promising!\n None. Although the Knicks were definitely tanking in February and early March until they remembered they didnt have a pick.\n In 2011, Cleveland sent J.J. Hickson to Sacramento for Omri Casspi, Sacramentos future pick (protected 1-12) and a signed, sealed confession from Geoff Petrie that hed given up and was just trying to hurt the Maloofs with stupid trades.\n Bigger mystery -- why do teams keep talking themselves into J.J. Hickson, or how do Glen Davis and Jared Sullinger gain weight during the season when theyre playing basketball every day?\n In January, Chicago traded Luol Deng for Andrew Bynums overweight/frowning/limping cap ghost and that same Sacramento pick.\n Its the nobody-feels-good-after-the-trade trade! You rarely see those. (But when you do, theres a good chance Cleveland is involved. We just had two in a row.) Im just glad Cleveland kept its own pick -- if it wins the lottery again, it should change its team name to the Cleveland Superfunds.\n Assuming the Kings keep this pick (and they will -- its no. 7 right now), it rolls over to 2015, 2016 or 2017 (top-10 protected). Unfortunately for Chicago, no Sacramento first-rounder has fallen outside the top 10 since 2008 -- its like holding a blank personal check from Lindsay Lohan.\n No need ... although Sacramento and Boston have done the best jobs of anyone at playing hard for 45 minutes and then blowing games late. Theyve really made it an art form. While were here, kudos to the Celtics for how theyre taking advantage of this \"Rondo cant play back-to-back games yet\" rule. Last week, they played him in an unwinnable game in Indiana on Tuesday, then sat him for a totally winnable home game against New York 24 hours later. Yes, they lost both games. Now thats how its done, my friends.\nSpeaking of tanking, the Cavs have no chance of catching Atlanta (theyre six games back for the no. 8 seed) even if Kyrie Irvings injury creates some Ewing Theory potential. I caught Cleveland in person on Sunday against the Clips -- thats the most miserable visiting team Ive seen in a couple years. They make the Kings or Wolves look like the 2008 Celtics. The normally happy-go-lucky Anderson Varejao looked like a little kid learning that his parents were getting divorced for two solid hours. Jarrett Jack and Dion Waiters were in \"Eff this, Im gettin mine\" mode. And poor Luol Deng looked he was waiting for Liam Neeson to save him. Did Mike Brown really have teams quit on him in consecutive seasons? That has to be a record, right? This Cavs franchise has been drunk for two and a half solid years. And not even about-to-pass-out drunk, more like wont-stop-talking-wont-go-to-bed-keeps-spilling-things drunk. Can somebody steal their car keys and put them in a cab?\n A 2012 three-teamer in which New Orleans got Robin Lopez and Hakim Warrick, Phoenix got Wesley Johnson and Minnesotas top-13 protected pick, and Sota got cap space and yet another segment for the future Emmy-winning 30 for 30 \n Did the Wolves quit on 2010s no. 4 overall pick after just two years to clear cap space to sign Andrei Kirilenko ... only to watch him leave a year later? Yes. Yes. They did. I cant fight it anymore.\n Its the no. 13 pick right now, so Minnesota would keep it, with that pick rolling over to 2015 (top-12 protected) or 2016 (ditto). Hey, did you know David Kahn is teaching a three-day April seminar at NYU called \n Are they following that one with a seminar from Billy Hunter called \"How to Successfully Run a Players Union While Resisting the Urge to Give Jobs to Multiple Members of Your Own Family\"? I mean, seriously.\n Very low. Phoenix (29 losses) only gets that pick by reverse-passing Minnesota (32 losses). Not on Jeff Hornaceks watch! Not on \n!\n Way back in 2010, Chicago sent Tyrus Thomas and a five-year supply of Alpo to Charlotte for a future pick (2014: protected 1-10).\n This kinda sorta maybe made up for Chicago picking LaMarcus Aldridge in 2006, then swapping him for Thomas. But not totally. Also, this is the trade you bring up whenever MJ is puffing on a cigar and bragging about the Gerald Wallace deal. (Hold that thought for later.)\n Right now, Chicago gets its own pick (no. 19) and Charlottes (no. 16). And its staying in that range. Youll see the Charlotte Horbobnetcats in Round 1. On NBA TV, sure ... but youll see them.\n In 2012, Atlanta sent Joe Johnson to Brooklyn for expirings, plus a 2013 first-rounder (no. 18: Shane Larkin), plus the right to swap first-rounders in 2014 and 2015, plus a 12-hour nap until the drugs wore off.\n Anytime you can absorb the leagues worst contract while giving up a first-rounder and weakening your pick in two other drafts, you have to do it.\n Boston sent Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry to Brooklyn for expirings and Gerald Wallaces contract, plus the lesser Atlanta/Brooklyn first-rounder in 2014, plus unprotected first-rounders in 2016 and 2018, plus the right to swap firsts in 2017. This wasnt a trade as much as a pillaging. And you wonder why Brooklyn made a serious run at Phil Jackson before the Knicks stepped in.\n Hey, Danny Ferry, Id like you to meet your new cellmate ... Danny Ainge.\n Right now, Atlanta gets no. 15 (from itself), Boston gets no. 18 (from Brooklyn) and Brooklyn gets a draft STD. Hey, Minnesota -- what about no. 4, no. 18 and Jared Sullinger for Kevin Love? Come on, you gave us KG and Big Papi, its tradition!\n Phoenix traded Marcin Gortat for Washingtons pick (top-12 protected), Emeka Okafor and 10 complimentary \"I JUST WON A TRADE WITH ERNIE GRUNFELD\" T-shirts. Not a collectors item.\n Whats sadder -- that Washington fans would definitely make this trade again, or that you cant even really blame them? Had they waited three months, Gortat would have cost only two second-rounders. But can you really nitpick when the same team that took Otto Porter and Jan Vesely with high lottery picks doesnt totally botch a front-office move? Even getting mildly beat in a trade -- thats a huge, huge, HUGE win for Wizards fans.\n Phoenix is definitely getting this pick (right now, its no. 17). And Washington is definitely paying Gortat twice what hes worth next summer. Who cares? CHOCOLATE CITY IS HEADED TO THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!!\n So this one gets convoluted. Right after the lockout ended, Dallas traded a future pick (top-20 protected) to the Lakers for the Artist Formerly Known As Lamar Odom, four \n cameramen, three missed urine tests and five unexcused absences to be named later. Whoops. L.A quickly flipped that pick to Houston to dump Derek Fishers contract (for Jordan Hill). In October 2012, Houston re-rerouted that pick to OKC in the James Harden hijacking.\n So it was a throwaway pick in two trades, then became OKCs Last Hope To Salvage The Worst Trade Of The 21st Century? Thats a pretty exciting top-20 protected no. 1 pick. Since were here, check out these numbers since the All-Star break.\n 26.7 PPG, 6.4 APG, 4.5 RPG, 49% FG, 42% 3FG, 37.6 MPG\n\n\n 3.6 PPG, 0.4 APG, 1.8 RPG, 29% FG, 21% 3FG, 12.2 MPG\n\n\n 2.0 PPG, 0.2 APG, 3.8 RPG, 53% FG, 00% 3FG, 16.1 MPG\n Dallas is the no. 7 seed right now, so OKC would get the pick (no. 22). Otherwise, it rolls over. Kind of like how OKC rolled over in the Harden trade.\n Golden State traded the Richard Jefferson-Andris Biedrins-Brandon Rush expirings plus unprotected picks in 2014 and 2017 to Utah for cap space, a prolonged handshake and five autographed copies of Karl Malones upcoming autobiography, \n.\n The Warriors made that trade to (a) clear enough cap space to sign Andre Iguodala, and (b) contend for the 2014 title. They arent contending for the 2014 title, just the \"Ridiculously Entertaining, Perpetually Frustrating, Probably Headed For A First-Round Exit And A Coaching Change\" title. Everyone wants to play them in Round 1. Everyone.\n Right now, Utah gets Golden States 23rd pick. You know whats not mentioned enough? Utah allowed Al Jefferson (killing it in Charlotte) and Paul Millsap (an All-Star) to leave so they could take on $24 million of bodies ... just to eventually get the 23rd pick in the 2014 draft and a 2017 unprotected pick, as well as some unabashed 2014 self-sabotage. Yet another example of the \"If I blow things up and convince my fans that rebuilding will take a few years, I get to keep my job the entire time\" GM theory (as covered \n last month).\n In 2011, Charlotte dealt Gerald Wallace for Portlands 2011 first-rounder (no. 19, Tobias Harris) and a future first (protected 1-12). MJ gets to mention this trade to everyone who thinks hes a bad owner. \n Within 18 months, Wallace got flipped to Brooklyn for a top-three protected pick that became Damian Lillard, then got thrown into Bostons Pierce-Garnett pillaging. Hes like the Kevin Bacon of crazily one-sided protected pick trades.\n Right now, Charlotte gets no. 24. So unless Detroit falls into the bottom eight, Charlotte gets no. 9 and no. 24 but loses no. 16. Got it? Im so glad we did this. Thanks for talking me into it.\n Phoenix traded Luis Scola for Indianas pick (top-14 protected), Gerald Green, Miles Plumlee and a lifetime of \"I JUST KICKED LARRY LEGENDS ASS IN AN NBA TRADE AND THERE WERE WITNESSES AND EVERYTHING!\" bragging rights for Suns GM Ryan McDonough.\n Holy mackerel, that trade was one-sided, especially with how well Green has been playing. Can you believe McDonough, a Boston kid who grew up loving the Celtics, somehow outwitted the Basketball Jesus in an NBA trade? If I beat 33 in a trade, Id have trouble sleeping at night. Check that -- I wouldnt trade with Larry Legend. Check that -- Id just give him my best players until I got fired, youre right.\n Right now, the Suns are picking no. 14 (their own), no. 17 (from Washington) and no. 29 (from Indy). Well done, Ryan McDonough. I hereby dub you the Anti-Kahn.\n(Wait a second, I still have almost 2,000 words to play with! Lets hit some other emails ... )\n\n\n\nSG: Um ... I watch basketball?\n\n\nSG: Tonight! Thats right, Jalen Rose and I are calling the Spurs-Lakers game with Mike Tirico. ESPN, 10:30 p.m. ET -- its the Dont Get Fired Classic!\n\n\nSG: Id go Knicks 1/2, Rockets 2/1 (Dwight 2.0), Bulls 2/1 (the smartest option), Charlotte 10/1 (Jordan Brand ties), Heat 12/1 (The Decision 2.0), Suns 25/1 (cap space!), Lakers 60/1 (Hollywood!). Jalen Rose has a funny take on this -- by using Phil Jackson as a smoke screen, Carmelo can grab that extra $30 million guaranteed without anyone ripping him for caring more about money than winning.\nTranslation: I WANT THE EXTRA $30 MILLION! Meanwhile, as weve been discussing on the B.S. Report for six weeks, the Rockets could easily clear Carmelo cap space by trading Omer Asiks deal (easy) and Jeremy Lins deal (theyd have to use a first-round pick and/or Terrence Jones to dump it). You know why you cant rule out Houston? Because weve heard the he-wont-go-there logic before with them. \nI mean, didnt we watch this movie last summer with Dwight? Along with Chicago, those are the two title-ready destinations for him. And theyre both in play. The Zen Master has some work to do.\n\n\nSG: Weve only really seen it one time -- in the 09 playoffs, when Dwight knocked Cleveland out with a monster Game 6 (and played well in the Finals, too). I said this on TV on Sunday and Im saying it again now: Dwights last week of basketball was pretty telling. The Rockets had just come off three \"WE ARE TITLE CONTENDERS!!!!\" victories over Miami, Indiana and Portland. They head to OKC for a message game, to play a team with only Steven Adams and Nick Collison to handle Dwight. He should foul both of those guys out in 20 minutes, right?\nSo what happens? Dwight no-shows. Nine points, 10 rebounds, 25 \"Does Dwight know this game is being televised?\" moments. Meanwhile, Durant knows no Rocket can guard him -- he eviscerates them for 42. Thats the difference between Dwight and Durant: One guy goes into that game thinking, \n. The other guy just goes into the game.\nTwo days later, Houston played in Chicago against Joakim Noah, Dwights chief rival for the first-team All-NBA spot. At shootaround that day, Kevin McHale says of Noah, \"He should be Defensive Player of the Year. Hes done a great job with these guys. Theyve been winning a lot just on his energy and effort, his kind of determination and toughness. Those are all qualities everybody appreciates.\" You know why that was interesting? Um ... KEVIN MCHALE COACHES DWIGHT HOWARD! AND THEY WERE PLAYING CHICAGO THAT NIGHT!!!!!! McHale did everything but light a big fire log and try to ram it up Dwights ass.\nHow did Dwight respond? The Rockets lost by 24. Dwight put up 12 and 10 with seven turnovers. Noah tossed up 13 and 10 with nine assists. Please, please, please, remember this game as youre filling out your All-NBA ballots. By the way, its Year 10 for Dwight Howard -- as I covered in \n, he is who he is at this point. Can you win the title if hes your SECOND-best player? Absolutely. Houstons only chance to seriously contend is if everyone agrees, \"This is James Hardens team.\" And they arent quite there yet.\n\n\nSG: So you wouldnt give the five-year max to Rubio?\n\n\nSG: None. Just remember, if I had this mailbag 25 years ago, I may have gotten this question:\n\n\nSG: Yup -- total brainfart. And in the section about \"Coming Home\" tributes, I mistakenly omitted Paul Pierces \"Coming Home\" video that the Celtics made for his return to Boston because of a tragic copy-paste error. Its the best one, too.\nBy the way, thanks to Van Doan in Davis, California, for making the \n/\"Im Coming Home\" mash-up I requested. High comedy.\n\n\nSG: That was the most popular question in a while. Philly wouldnt get past the Sweet 16 -- this is the worst NBA team Ive ever seen. I think every 1- and 2-seed would beat them; I think Syracuse, Duke, Louisville and Michigan State would beat them; and I think Arizona and Florida would blow them out. Maybe this would be a good NBA lottery wrinkle: Every NBA team that cant win 20 games has to play the NCAA champ in a 40-minute game. If they cant beat the college team, they cant get a top-three pick.\n\n\nSG: My Final Four: Florida, Michigan State, Duke, Arizona. My winner: Michigan State over Arizona. Now please, go against me.\n\n\nSG: LeBron and Durant, definitely. Anthony Davis, maybe. And for some reason, I love Russell Westbrook for this question. Couldnt you see Russ going off, shooting 35 times a game and playing like an absolute maniac?\n\n\nSG: Seven things arent going anywhere in Chicago: Gibsons, Garrett Popcorn, Wrigley, deep-dish pizza, the Blackhawks logo, the MJ statue and Derrick Rose. Everyone in Chicago would riot. The Bulls arent trading him. But Rose is also coming off two major knee surgeries and has overwhelming Penny Hardaway 2.0 potential. So lets flip this the other way -- we remove the salary cap for three hours, and every OTHER team can trade for Derrick Rose. I think these 22 players would cause teams to pass ...\nLeBron James; Kevin Durant or Russell Westbrook; Blake Griffin or Chris Paul; James Harden or Dwight Howard; Anthony Davis; Anthony Davis a second time; Steph Curry; Paul George; Kevin Love; LaMarcus Aldridge; Marc Gasol; Carmelo Anthony; Damian Lillard; John Wall; Tony Parker; Andre Drummond; Kyrie Irving; Serge Ibaka; Chris Bosh; and yes, Goran Dragic. The teams with those 22 guys would examine Roses injury history, look at his intimidating salary and get freaked out. As for Rajon Rondo, DeMarcus Cousins or whoever ... either its exceedingly debatable, or theyd grab Rose in two seconds. Either way, I hate these two paragraphs and miss watching Rose play. Lets move on.\n\n\nSG: Incredible. Just incredible. Is Bargnani the Weeden of basketball, or vice versa?\n\n\nSG: The Plumlee brothers cant fathom that you left them out of this conversation. Theyre on Skype just staring at each other in disbelief right now. Along with naivete and overconfidence, Jesse forgot one crucial element: the Bradley Award candidate has to be a decent dunker in his own right. For instance, did you see the Rich Mans Plumlee (Mason) get embedded by Gerald Green earlier this week? As Gerald worked up a head of steam, just about anyone else would have said, \"Im getting out of here, I dont want to end up on YouTube.\" But Mason decided, \"Im not afraid of Gerald Green, Im gonna block this!\"\nAnd thats how you end up on YouTube. My top-five finalists for 2014s Bradley Award: (1) Miles, (2) Mason, (3) Cody Zeller, (4) Tyler Zeller, (5) Mullens. By the way, we may or may not be working on a 30 for 30 short about Bradley called \n. (Like you wouldnt watch this.)\n\n\nSG: Yup, these are my readers."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/the-action-hero-championship-belt/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/above-the-rim-tupac-shakur-duane-martin-basketball-movie-bill-simmons/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/fixing-the-nba-playoffs/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/david-letterman-retires-cbs/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/nba-mailbag-this-is-the-end/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/the-worlds-most-exclusive-club/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/nba-playoffs-2014-33-burning-questions-from-round-1/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/sterlings-fold/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/simmons-oklahoma-city-thunder-nba-championship/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/simmons-on-the-road-its-all-on-lebron/", "blog_text": "Greetings from Indiana, the home of Larry Legend, Jimmy Chitwood, St. Elmoas, the Indy 500 and a relentlessly confusing Pacers team. Two years ago, Indianapolis hosted the Super Bowl and exceeded everyoneas expectations (\n), handling the crush of people with ease while somehow maintaining a homey feel. I loved that entire week ... you know, right until Brady overthrew a wide-open Welker by maybe 15 inches for the clinching touchdown, then the Patriots blew another Super Bowl to the freaking Giants. \n.\nIf only sports fans could swallow pills to erase specific plays from their brains like they were \n characters. I will never stop seeing Welker line up for that play, with New Yorkas secondary in chaos as their D-backs scrambled to figure out their coverage. Inexplicably, they abandoned the entire left side of the field and left it that way. They should have just planted the Lombardi Trophy in the corner of the end zone with a sign that said, aWELKER a THIS IS YOURS.a\nWelker noticed immediately. Brady noticed, too. Since it happened right in front of us, my buddy Jamie and I both noticed and started furiously elbowing each other. Every Giants fan in our section noticed and started shrieking in disbelief. For about five seconds there, we were going to avenge the Helmet Catch game. I canat spend time in Indianapolis without drifting back to those five seconds, and the beauty of the day itself a how we kicked things off by \n (just two days after \n), how the sun never stopped shining, how Indianapolis never stopped radiating good vibes. Everything was perfect. I still canat believe we lost.\nTwenty-seven months later, I canat believe the Pacers have a chance to derail LeBronas three-peat. When we were in New Orleans for All-Star Weekend, the Pacers had won 40 of 52 games and loomed as a legitimate contender. Their best five guys played better together than anyone elseas best five guys. Roy Hibbert had blossomed into this generationas Dikembe. Paul George was filming commercials and \n. The immortal Lance Stephenson was everyoneas favorite All-Star snub. I remember running into Frank Vogel, whom Iave known since his Boston days, and he couldnat have seemed happier about everything. Loved his team, loved the landscape, loved their title chances, loved everything. He couldnat stop smiling.\nThatas what made the next few weeks so incomprehensible. \n in \n on Grantland, as Vogel slowly became more intense than Michael Fassbender during the last 40 minutes of \n, but nobody could answer the fundamental question: aWHAT HAPPENED???a During their embarrassing Round 1 series against the undermanned Hawks, I created a \n Pat Rileyas Disease of Me (30 percent); too many minutes for the worn-down starting five (20 percent); no incumbent superstar who could say aDonat worry, I got thisa (10 percent); Lance Stephenson being the one saying, aDonat worry, I got thisa (20 percent); and maybe-they-werenat-that-good-to-begin-with (20 percent). Hibbertas unexpected transformation into Hasheem Thabeet didnat crack the pie chart. Neither did their broken chemistry, which I described as atheyare interacting like divorced parents who just ran into each other at their sonas youth soccer game.a Everything looked bad. Everything.\nAnd you know what? They were ready to roll over in Atlanta, in Game 6, when they trailed by five with 3:15 remaining. You always have those playoff games when things look bleak, and everyone glances around and wonders, \n For Indiana, that guy isnat Paul George a itas David West. West drew a foul and made both free throws, stole the ball from Pero Antic on the next possession, then drained a 19-footer to pull them within one. They were fine after that. One round later, against a scary Washington team thatas probably still kicking itself for squandering that series, Indy blew a sizable Game 6 lead in the fourth quarter. West sank the crucial jumper to grab the lead back, then swished three other shots to ice the series.\nQuick tangent: These last few years saw something of a sea change in NBA philosophies, driven by the advanced-metrics boom and an increasing number of new owners with hedge fund backgrounds. With a philosophical battle brewing between the old-school Eye Test guys and the new-wave numbers guys, itas been funny (and a little ridiculous) to watch this turn into an either/or thing. Ideally, you should blend both worlds into one larger vision a thatas one of many reasons why San Antonio keeps thriving even with Duncan heading toward his 40th birthday. The Spurs value the new-wave thinking (for instance, they mastered corner 3s before just about everyone else) while also putting significant stock in personalities and chemistry. Gregg Popovich has done everything short of admitting publicly, \nOn the flip side, you have the 2014 Rockets, a team that made sense on paper and executed a vision that looked great on paper a one big guy, lots of shooters, lots of 3s a only they never solved their fundamental Eye Test issues. Can you really win a title when your best two players arenat leaders? Can you really throw out chemistry and assume math will carry you for four rounds? The Rockets blew multiple close games against Portland for a variety of reasons, but mainly because they didnat have anyone like West a the seen-it-all veteran who would have made those three or four weare-screwed-if-someone-doesnat-score-right-now jumpers, told Dwight to stop bitching, yelled aGET YOUR HEAD INTO THE SERIES, WE F--ING NEED YOU!a at James Harden, and grabbed Chandler Parsonsas jersey in the final second of Game 6 and said calmly, aIf thereas a switch and you let Lillard get a wide-open 3, Iam beating you to death.a\nThere arenat a lot of these guys left a reliable veterans \n thrive when their team needs them most. Over the past 20 years, these guys ranged in all shapes and sizes. Hakeemas Rockets had Sam Cassell and Mario Elie. Shaqas Lakers had Brian Shaw, Rick Fox and Derek Fisher. The mid-2000s Pistons had Chauncey Billups. The 2008 Celts had Eddie House and James Posey. The 2011 Mavs had Jason Kidd and Jason Terry. These last two Miami teams had Mike Miller, Udonis Haslem and Shane Battier. Other than West, what other non-superstar veterans currently fit that profile other than Paul Pierce? What in-their-prime guys could even sniff this conversation other than a maybe a Mike Conley, Kyle Lowry and Shaun Livingston? What younger guys could evolve into that role other than Reggie Jackson (an obvious candidate) and maybe Kemba Walker?\nI donat know what happened to those guys, or even what we should call them. Soul Providers? Heart Transplants? Scrotal Enhancers? Whatever name you create, just know that West is the best of the bunch right now. He saved Indianaas season for two straight rounds. And so I thought Miami would finish them off in Round 3, but I overlooked three things ...\nYou could see it in Game 1 a they clearly relish being underdogs again. Even their fans relish it. Multiple Pacers fans yelled at me during Game 1, still angry that I picked Washington over them. An entire section to the right of our TV set even chanted aSimmons Sucks!a for a few seconds before switching gears and showering former Pacer Jalen Rose with love. I thought it was fantastic even as I started to secretly worry about the hotel chef \n the next time I ordered room service. The Pacers have fantastic fans; they SHOULD take this stuff personally.\nBut thatas the thing a these players and their fans are better off being angry, feeling like nobody believes in them, worrying about being the overlooked small market all over again and fretting that the other teamas superstar is always getting the calls. Thatas their identity. Thatas their DNA. Being the favorite, meeting a certain level of expectations, dealing with adversity, wearing that bulls-eye all the time ... maybe thatas not what they were meant to do. Can you imagine how these Pacers would have handled the V. Stiviano saga if Donald Sterling owned them (and not the Clippers)? Yikes. But none of that matters now. Nobody believes in them. Theyare back to who they are.\nThis isnat even good-natured asports-hate,a a concept \n with Peyton Manning and Kobe Bryant a you can sports-hate a player or team without genuinely hating them. I sports-hate Peytonas guts, but I donat actually hate \n, if that makes sense. Well, Pacers fans actually HATE the Heat. You could feel the hostility brewing during the pregame intros a aBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!a a and you could feel their collective animosity brewing every time a Miami player did something they didnat like. When Mario Chalmers pushed C.J. Watson into the cameraman, they reacted like Little League parents who just watched the opposing coach shove a finger into their childas chest. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\nAnd thatas a subtle but important difference between the first two rounds and Round 3 a you canat work up that kind of enmity toward a 38-win Hawks team and the young upstart Wizards. You just canat. Is that why Indiana went 3-4 at home in the first two rounds? Not entirely ... but it certainly didnat help. We know when the Pacers thrive: when theyare overachieving, when their fans are pushing them, when they canat let themselves relax for even one second. All that prosperity handicapped them. It fundamentally changed who they were. It canat be a coincidence that they played their most passionate basketball in three months on Sunday. Of course ...\nThatas the real reason Indiana has a chance here a Miami whiffed on free agency with last offseasons Oden-Beasley signings, leaving the Heat with an older, creakier version of last yearas championship team, which came within one rebound of losing in Game 6. You canat look at a single Heat player and say, aThat guy is better now than he was a year ago,a with the possible exception of Chris Andersen. Battier and Haslem look washed-up. Bosh morphed into a 3-point specialist who never posts up anymore. Ray Allen will give you two good games per series and thatas it. The Mario ChalmersaNorris Cole point guard combo is more unreliable than ever. Dwyane Wade isnat a top-20 player anymore; if there was a startling revelation from Game 1, itas that Lance Stephenson spent four quarters thinking to himself, \n ... and he might not have been wrong.\nSo itas LeBron and LeBron and LeBron and also LeBron, and more than ever, LeBron. Thereas a decent chance that the Pacers regained their mojo a much like a TV show that gets derailed by a stupid subplot for a few months, then the writers fix things and youare suddenly saying, aWow, that was easy, this show is really good again! Weare back!a Or maybe theyare just comfortable playing against Miami thanks to all the reps over these past two seasons a eight regular-season games, eight playoff games a and a matchup thatas strangely favorable for them.\nBut yesterdayas game was eye-opening. We were reminded that Hibbert loves playing this team, that Miami doesnat have anyone to defend West, that Paul George was created by scientists to defend LeBron (not stop him totally, but at least make him work), that Lance loves going at Wade, that George Hill canat get exposed against that Chalmers-Cole combo. We were reminded that Bosh, for whatever reason, absolutely sucks against Indiana a we now have a 16-game sample size of Bosh averaging 11 and 4 against Hibbert and West (not a misprint). And we were reminded that, for Miami to advance, itas going to take yet another superhuman effort from LeBron James. Maybe even a super-duperhuman effort. The Heat spent four years riding on LeBron, Wade, defense, Bosh and 3s, in that order ... and right now, they can only count on LeBron from game to game. Thatas pretty sobering.\nCan the Pacers keep the momentum going? Who the hell knows? Itas the Pacers! Itas like trying to guess the results of a roulette wheel. They could score 54 points in Game 2 and I wouldnat be shocked. But if they can keep coming relatively close to that unexpected Game 1 performance, and if they can keep getting passionately insane crowds from the leagueas best arena, this could turn frightening pretty quickly for Miami. Is LeBron having 2010 Cavs flashbacks? Does he have enough reserve strength to fight through a seven-game war and prevail on the road? Is his own version of Jordanas Game 6 in Utah looming, when he has to effectively defeat an opponent by himself or lose out on a three-peat?\nI donat have the answers. But when youare in the home of the Basketball Jesus and Jimmy Chitwood and Bobby Knight and Bobby Plump and Norman Dale and Steve Alford and everyone else, with those fans going bonkers, and Larry Legend sitting there IN THE BUILDING? Thatas when you donat want to be an aging opponent looking for answers. Your move, LeBron."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-nba-draft-lottery-karma-rankings/", "blog_text": "Here are your odds for tonights NBA draft lottery ...\n \nTechnicality No. 1: Denver gets the higher pick in the Denver-Orlando-New York scenario; Orlando gets the lower pick; and New York gets nothing because God hates the Knicks.\n If anyone leapfrogs Detroit and the Pistons drop to no. 9 or lower, Charlotte gets that pick (so somebody needs to flag down MJ on the ninth hole and tell him he might win a lottery pick tonight).\n New Orleans only keeps its pick if it lands in the top three. Otherwise, Philly gets it thanks to the Jrue Holiday hijacking. Er, trade.\nGot it? Are we good?\nOne more important note: Joel Embiid is going to be the first pick of the 2014 draft. Dont let anyone tell you differently. These teams are full of it. \n Hold on, Im actually going to stand under the bull as he craps on me. Its Smokescreen Central right now. And enough with the Oden parallels; unless Embiids pre-draft MRI reveals a career-threatening back issue (doubtful), NOBODY is passing on a franchise center who could easily be described as \"The 7-Foot Serge Ibaka.\" Stop it. Hes going first. Were officially calling tonights lottery \"Bleed for Embiid.\"\nWith that stuff out of the way, lets focus on the percentages that really matter -- the 2014 Lottery Karma Rankings! Its not about what the Ping-Pong balls say, its about what the Karma Gods say.\nDo your boys REALLY deserve to win the lottery? Did they handle their business the right way last season? Did they embarrass themselves with a tanking fiasco? Did they make a shady trade that inadvertently affected the playoff race? Did they do anything that made you say, \"They just took a poop on their fans\"? Have they been so inept for so many years that their ineptitude just shouldnt be rewarded anymore? Did they make any aggressively stupid decisions like paying Josh Smith and Brandon Jennings $78 million combined without hiring them a strong coach, or gift-wrapping a $48.5 million extension to an injured and possibly washed-up Kobe Bryant without making sure he could still play basketball three times a week? Are they owned by someone youd describe as \"an incompetent legacy kid whod be working in a grocery store if his dad werent rich\" or even \"possibly concussed, he should seriously get his head checked out\"?\nAnd on the flip side, are they doing everything the right way? Do they have a real plan? Did they make an honest attempt to make the playoffs? Could you describe them as \"exceedingly well run\" and/or \"just a solid, solid organization\"? Did they make one or more trades that could be described as \"genuinely smart\" or even \"stunning in its vision and scope\"? Are they a franchise that makes you say, \"If Embiid/Wiggins/Jabari ends up there, theyll take care of that guy\"? Have they had bad lottery luck in the past? Are they due for a lottery break? Should the Karma Gods be saying, \"We feel bad, we gotta hook those guys up\"?\nWithout further ado, the 2014 Bleed For Embiid Lottery Karma Rankings ...\n\nI cant decide what makes them more ineligible for karma -- would you go with \"two no. 1 overall picks and two other top-four picks just in the past three years, but they batted 25 percent,\" or would you go with \"rehired the same shaky coach they already fired, gave him a five-year deal, then fired him again after Year 1\"? When Obama appoints me the Czar of Sports, Im making this rule: \"No NBA team can win the lottery two times in a 10-year span.\" Much less three. Its too bad Brick Tamland isnt a real person, because the Cavs definitely would have hired him as their coach/GM.\n\nJust for screwing up Kevin Loves contract and letting him leave after three years (instead of locking him down for five), theyre out. Also not helping: Did you know this is Sotas 10th straight lottery? Ten straight??? From 2006 through 2011, the Timberwolves had SEVEN picks ranging between no. 2 and no. 7. Theyre the real-life equivalent of your college buddy who had three kids way too early in life and now uses your fantasy football draft as an excuse to get bombed because he got out of the house for four hours.\n\nHeaded for their eighth straight lottery and their sixth straight top-seven pick (unless someone leapfrogs them). Im an NBA Republican -- I dont think we should use the lottery, year after year, to keep propping up incompetent teams. Its a broken system. We need a \"Make eight straight lotteries and youre ineligible from getting a top-three pick\" rule. Also, I still havent forgiven Kings owner Vivek Ranadive from trying to steal my Entertaining As Hell Tournament idea. Lets hope hes not the Carlos Mencia of NBA owners.\n\nPut it this way: I wrote an entire column about them last March called \"\n.\" The Karma Gods cant reward anyone who lost 26 straight, much less anyone who turned Michael Carter-Williams into a stat-chasing, brick-laying, award-pursuing mess who learned that its OK to lose as long as you throw up an 18-7-7. Even if you cant blame Philly for taking advantage of a broken system, that doesnt mean the Lottery Karma Gods cant scream at them in their Soup Nazi voice, \"NO KARMA FOR YOU!\"\n\nCome on, they already won the lottery three times! And three good ones, too: Shaq, C-Webb and Dwight. I think were good, Orlando.\nJust for fun, heres your lifetime NBA Lottery Winner Scoreboard: Cavaliers (4); Clippers (3); Magic (3); Bucks (2); Bulls (2); Hornets (2); Nets (2); Spurs (2); Wizards (2); 76ers (1); Blazers (1); Kings (1); Knicks (1); Raptors (1); Rockets (1); Warriors (1).\nBut heres the craziest and most fascinating NBA lottery fact ever in the history of crazy and fascinating lottery facts: Through 29 NBA lotteries dating back to 1985, only one franchise ever won the NBA title with its own no. 1 overall pick. The team? San Antonio with David Robinson (two titles) and Tim Duncan (four titles, two with Robinson). How is that possible?\n\nSorry, they totally botched the Chris Paul trade (and gave him to Donald Sterling, no less!), netted about 23 cents on the dollar for him, then were summarily rewarded by \n winning the Anthony Davis Lottery. Hes only the NBAs third-best asset right now and the logical answer to the question, \"Whos winning the MVP trophy after LeBron and Durant are done passing it back and forth?\" I think were good from a karma standpoint, New Orleans. Throwing a couple karma slabs your way only because I love the Brow.\n\nYou gotta respect the year-to-year greatness of this franchise. Since 1958, they missed the playoffs only five times. They won only 27 games last year; thats somehow their lowest total since 1958. Theyve never won the lottery; since 1982, theyve never picked higher than 10th. They won 11 of the last 42 titles and appeared in 26 of the last 55 Finals. Since Elgin Baylor joined the Lakers in 1958, theyve trotted out at least one historically great superstar in 49 of the past 56 seasons. And theyve produced at least 3.5 million annoying fans (easily a league record).\nOn the other hand ... theyre due to suck for a few years. Right? Why should THEY get the no-sucking-ever exemption? Well see if the Karma Gods think Lakers fans should suffer for a few years or not.\n(By the way, if the Lakers win the lottery tonight, it will be one of the funniest Internet moments of all time and -- since Ill be appearing on live TV on ESPN -- Im just about guaranteed to get fired for what Ill say afterward. I dont know if this means the Lakers should get more or fewer karma points.)\n\nDoor A: Hire a competent coach, then re-sign Al Jefferson and Paul Millsap (two really good players).\nDoor B: Let Jefferson and Millsap go; trade for $20 million in Golden States expirings and pick up two G-State first-rounders in 2014 and 2017 that almost definitely wont be in the lottery; then keep Ty Corbin as your coach just to make sure your team sucks enough for 2014 lottery purposes.\nMy verdict: I dont think the Lottery Karma Gods loved how this played out.\n\nLets be honest -- the Karma Gods already threw them a solid with the whole \"instead of losing your team to a superior offer from Seattle, we miraculously found two billionaire hedge fund guys who want to keep the Bucks in Milwaukee even if were not totally sure that Milwaukee loves professional basketball\" thing. But unlike Philly, this franchise actually tried to compete -- they spent money on midlevel free agents like O.J. Mayo, Gary Neal and Zaza Pachulia, overpaid Larry Sanders and made a sincere run at 40 wins and a first-round playoff sweep. Did that sincere run make any sense whatsoever? No!!!!!!!!!!!!! Absolutely not!!!! But at least they tried ... right?\n(Also, Viva La Greek Freak.)\n(Also, this is the other \"Funniest Twitter-Related Outcome\" for the no. 1 pick. You know, considering they just sold the team and all ... and considering we just watched the same thing happen with New Orleans two years ago.)\n\nDo you penalize them for the never-ending slew of head-scratching trades and signings, all the coaches they hired and fired, and all the money they tossed away? Or do you say, \"Its time for a fresh start for DEEEEEEE-troit basssssssketball with Andre Drummond, Stan Van Gundy and a top-three lottery pick, followed by the down-low hiring of V. Stiviano to secretly bait Josh Smith and Brandon Jennings into saying something terrible into a tape recorder so they can void both of their contracts\"?\n(You know what? Im going with the latter. The NBA is more fun when the Pistons are good. They cleaned house, theyre moving forward, they made a very smart hiring with SVG, and now they deserve a break, dammit. Also, Jalen Rose would start throwing $100 bills into Indianas crowd tonight if his Pistons won the lottery.)\n\nTurned a high-functioning, 57-win team into a dysfunctional, 36-win team mostly through organizational incompetence. So why stick them this high? Because theres a remote chance they could win the lottery with New Yorks Ping-Pong balls (thanks to the Carmelo trade from years ago). Who has worse karma than the Knicks? Isnt this destiny? For one night, the Nuggets get to bask in the bizarro glow of James Dolans basketball karma. Even if they have a 0.8 percent chance of winning, once you factor in Dolan, that jumps to 25 percent easy. I have a weird feeling about this one.\n\nYou gotta admit, they sold as high as possible on Pierce and Garnett (three unprotected no. 1s from Brooklyn in 2014, 2016 and 2018 plus a pick swap in 2017) and Doc Rivers (an unprotected no. 1 in 2015 that has a punchers chance of becoming a gem if the Sterlings fight to keep the Clippers and every Clipper decides, \"I am suing to play for a different team\"). You cant execute an impromptu rebuilding plan better than that.\nAlso helping from a karma standpoint: As a lifelong Celtics fan, Ive suffered through three tanking seasons (1997, 2007 and 2014) ... and of those three teams, this was the only tanker that actually made me proud. They competed just about every night for Brad Stevens, blowing close game after close game because they didnt have a crunch-time guy. It was the perfect tanking season, actually. I never felt like I had to take one of those 40-minute showers to get the stink off me. Throw in the way they handled Docs return, Pierces return and KGs return and its hard to say the Celtics didnt accrue some legitimate karma here. Then again, Im a humongous homer.\n\nYou cant play it better than the Suns played it these past 15 months. They nailed the Jeff Hornacek and Ryan McDonough hirings. They successfully reunited the Morris twins and transformed them into NBA assets. They fleeced the Clippers with that Eric Bledsoe-Caron Butler for Jared Dudley-J.J. Redick trade, and then they pillaged none other than the Basketball Jesus with the Gerald Green-Miles Plumlee-2014 no. 1 for Luis Scola trade. They tried like hell to make the playoffs, winning 48 games and falling short on the final week (and only because they played in the West). They left themselves with four first-rounders and a buttload of 2014 cap space. They even made me say the words, \"Hey, maybe Robert Sarver is turning into a good owner after all.\"\nWhat am I missing? Who played this better than the Suns? Even if they have a 1-in-200 chance of winning the 2014 lottery, at least they can sleep tonight knowing that the Lottery Karma Gods were applauding them. Well done, Phoenix.\nLast note: If I have a heart attack on live TV at any point during tonights lottery, its been nice knowing you.

I really hope some of his luck rubs off on me. Heres my Love-Wiggins plan in threeA parts:\nFirst, Id convince Gilbert that, instead of doing the wrong thing every time and improbably having it work out in our favor, we should attempt to make the \n decision for once. This would be part of a bigger game plan that Im tentatively calling \"Dont Do the Wrong Thing Every Time Anymore.\"\nSecond, Id convince Gilbert that the Timberwolves dontA want to trade Love yet. If they did, they would have traded him before the 2014 draft, when they could have scored the biggest package of draft picks for him AND picked at least one of those players. Theyd much rather justA keep leaking out that theyre continuing \"talks\" with Golden State about a LoveaDavid LeeaKlay Thompson deal even if the Warriors have done everything short of putting up billboards around the Bay Area that read \"WE ARE NEVER TRADING KLAY THOMPSON.\"\nMy theory: Minnesota GM/president/coach/pooh-bah/czar/second-luckiest man in professional sports because how the F is he this powerful???/head honcho Flip Saunders has been in job-preservation mode ever since he snookered Glen Taylor into giving him that job. Letas say you trade Love, one of the leagueas 10 to 12 best players, and he comes back to haunt you on another team. Or letas say you land a young astuda in that trade who doesnat turn out to be exactly what you thought hed be, or you make a high lottery pick that isntA as sure of a thing as you thought hed be. Well, youare done. Youare out. Youare in Bristol doing Coors Light Cold Hard Facts.\nBut if you bring Love back for his contract year, now hes playing for a mega-deal on a Minnesota team that underachieved last season -- thanks to a ridiculously competitive conference, poor coaching from Rick Adelman (since retired) and historically bad luck in close games. Couldnt your team blossom like the Blazers did last season? Remember when we thought LaMarcus Aldridge was fleeing Portland a|A right until it turned into a playoff team and made the second round? What if thats Minnesota next season? Its not inconceivable, right?\nTrust me -- Flip keeps playing that Aldridge-Portland scenario in his head. More importantly, he cant even find a poor mans Godfather offer for Love, much less an actual Godfather offer. (Golden State wouldnt even pony up Thompson for him!) Flip wants no part of this generations one-sided \"Charles Barkley for Jeff Hornacek, Andrew Lang and Tim Perry\" trade that was horrible at the time and looks even more egregious 22 years later.\nMy guess: Hed rather keep Love for now, roll the dice with the Aldridge-Portland scenario, and then, if Minnesota starts off slow, he can always deal him before Februarys deadline.\nThat brings me to the third thing Id bring to Gilberts attention: You know who else doesnt need to make a move right away? The Cleveland Cavaliers! Whats the rush? Why do we have to finish our roster in July? Whats wrong with riding out the current nucleus for a few months, getting everyone in a training camp with LeBron, then seeing how everyone meshes with him?\nWhat if Wiggins shows signs -- day after day after day -- of becoming the Pippen to LeBrons MJ? What if LeBron is throwing him crazy alley-oops left and right and gushing, \"Ive always wanted to play with a freak athlete like this\"?\nWhat if Wiggins and LeBron are roaming around defensively like coyotes, stripping dudes at midcourt, jumping passing lanes and basically looking like mid-1990s Pippen and MJ reincarnated?\nWhat if sending Wiggins to Playing With LeBron Camp turned out to be the greatest thing that ever happened to Andrew Wiggins? What if this single-handedly altered his professional destiny? What if LeBron turned him into his basketball clone, much like Jordan brainwashed Pippen into evolving into his perfect sidekick?\nHeres the point: THE CAVALIERS HAVE TO FIND OUT. And theyll know, or at least have a really good idea, by December or January.\nAnd guess what. That same Wiggins-for-Love deal will still be sitting there after Christmas. None of the other 28 teams are trumping it. If it has to be done, then it has to be done -- the Cavs cant waste the rest of LeBrons prime if Wiggins isnt close to being ready yet, not with LeBron passing 40,000 career minutes during the first quarter of his first 2014 Cavs game. Theres a shelf life here. The Cavaliers cant take their sweet time and wait for their supporting cast to catch up with the greatest player of his generation. They cant.\nAt the same time, I need to see LeBron and the younguns for a few months before I swing a mega-deal. I want to see how Kyrie Irving and Wiggins blend with LeBron -- if they figure out how to run with him, space the floor for him, ease some of his playmaking burden and let HIM be the guy taking advantage of everyone elses young legs for once. I want to see if Dion Waiters can become this generations Vinnie Johnson, a.k.a. Microwave 2.0. I want to see if Anderson Varejao can stay healthy for the first time since 1975, and I want to see if Tristan Thompson and Anthony Bennett jump a level because theyre suddenly playing with one of the leagues best passers.\nI mean a|A is it OK that I see this for 45 to 50 games? Is that fine with everyone?\nBest-case scenario: Wiggins proves to be untouchable and Bennett shows signs of becoming a late bloomer/belated keeper, followed by Flip begrudgingly settling for a February deal of Love for Bennett, Waiters, two unprotected first-round picks (including Miamis first-rounder thats unprotected in 2017) and one pick swap over the next five years a|A a deal that, by the way, is still better than any other offer theyll get. Yes, including the right to overpay David Lee and eventually overpay Klay Thompson.\nWorst-case scenario: Wiggins suffers enough growing pains that you no longer feel fearful or guilty about flipping him for Love in February a|A which means Cleveland would be trotting out one of the seven best basketball players of all time and one of the leagues 12 best players as his sidekick.\nIn summary, the CavaliersA cant lose no matter what happens. I look forward to them screwing up the final decision and somehow having it work out. In Gilbert We Trust.\nHeres what the other Grantlanders think a|\nIf you deal Wiggins for Love, you obviously have the best team in the East. You obviously have the ability to spread the floor and outscore everyone, and the premise of Love throwing full-courtA outlet passes to Irving and LBJ would make all of November feel like aA McDonalds AllA AmericanA Game.\nThese are the obvious details everyone will mention when considering this hypothetical. But I would still stick with Wiggins, and my reasons are threefold:\nA I am not totally convinced Love is much more than an incredibly skilled fantasy player. He certainly might be, but how could we possibly know (based on experience)? Such a move would still be a gamble. He doesnt protect the rim. He seems inordinately interested in numbers. And those aforementioned full-courtA outlet passes evaporate in June.\nA Up until the Big 12 tournament, Uncle Wiggily was pretty underwhelming at Kansas. He had a few games in whichA his shooting was tragic, especially off the dribble. But he has the body, and thats what matters. His body is better than Loves. He defends the whole floor. Hes an underrated glass chewer. And if we all concede that Wiggins has the \nA to be a transcendent player, placing him alongside a bike-riding maniac like LeBron is the best-case scenario. If you throw 20-year-old W with LBJ, you will get the totality of whatever he has to offer (and then you re-sign him for life). LeBron will not let him bust.\nA The Cavs signed LeBron. Hes the best player in the world. Let him prove it. Enough of this pandering. No more roster additions. No more gaming the system to make things easier. This is the team. \n. That letter James \"wrote\" to \n? Idiotic. It was totally idiotic. Im not interested in constructed apologies or histrionic aphorisms. Just go do this.\naShould Cleveland give up a guy who has the potential to be one of the top five players on the planet in seven years for a guy who hasnat madeA the playoffs in his six-year career? Before you answer, consider that the guy for whom Cleveland is trading is reportedly going to bolt his team in free agency next season if he isnat traded, meaning Cleveland holds pretty much all the bargaining chips here.a\nUm, no?\nThat the Cavs ever considered this trade as a possibility tells you how insecure the Cleveland sports scene is. Itas like as soon as LeBron announced his decision to return, Kool &A the Gang was blasted through the entire city on loop as Clevelanders danced in the streets and Frenched strangers. Then, after a few days of this, someone tapped Cleveland on the shoulder and told it LeBron signed only a two-year deal that includes a player option after the first year. Even though itas fairly obvious that LeBronas deal was structured in anticipation of a projected salary cap rise, the music was still cut as every Clevelander went through the same mental anguish.\n.\nDonat get me wrong here aA the Cavs should be making moves to win now. LeBron + Anderson Varejao + Brendan Haywood + guys who havenat hit puberty yet doesnat strike me as an immediate championship formula. But taking a few young pieces out of the mix and throwing in Love suddenly turns the Cavs into the obvious choice for Eastern Conference champions. So Iam all for going after Love.\nIam just not for giving up Wiggins. A lot of people seem to misunderstand the talk surrounding Wiggins and assume that because heas described as a guy with a ton of potential, he must therefore be a gamble. But just because his ceiling is so high doesnat mean his cellar is just as low. In truth, even if Wiggins never asserts himself offensively as consistently as he should, heas still likely going to be a 15-plus PPGA guy and one of the best perimeter defenders in the league.\nThat last bit is huge. The Cavs are in a great spot as it stands by having a young guy who can help LeBron carry the offensive load (Irving) and another who can help carry the defensive load (Wiggins). Wiggins on the Cavs means LeBron wonat always have to guard the other teamas best player. It also means Cleveland could conceivably have the two best perimeter defenders in the game three years from now. That might not sound as sexy as a 26-and-12 guy joining LeBron, until you realize that a Cavs defense with Wiggins and LeBron will get infinity steals, those steals will trigger fast breaks, and those fast breaks will end with one of those guys putting his nuts aboveA the rim.\nThrow anything else at Minnesota to get Kevin Love to Cleveland. Just donat touch LeBron, Irving, or Wiggins.\nRationally speaking, you canat really argue for not trading Andrew Wiggins for Kevin Love. CritiquesA of Loveas game often revolve around the dearth of playoff appearances and his being a stat-stuffer. My retort would be that, if the 2013-14 Timberwolves were in the Eastern Conference, they surely would have made the postseason.A And even if he is a stats hog, holy shit, look at those stats!\nLast season, Love scored 2,010 points, pulled down 963 rebounds, and dished out 341 assists.\nThe list of players who have scored more thanA 2,000 points, grabbed more thanA 950 rebounds, and dished more than 300 assists in one season is as follows: Kareem six times (1969-70, 1971-72, 1972-73, 1973-74, 1975-76, 1976-77), Wilt Chamberlain twice (1963-64, 1965-66), Elgin Baylor twice (1960-61, 1962-63), Oscar Robertson (1961-62), Bob McAdoo (1975-76), Billy Cunningham (1969-70), Charles Barkley (1988-89), and Tim Duncan (2001-02). Iad call that good company.\nWiggins is a very talented, ultra-athletic incoming rook who has a great chance to be a defensive destroyer and a star. He doesnat need the ball, and thatas a plus on a team with Kyrie, LeBron, and (for now?) Waiters. But, again, Love isA coming off a historically good season.\nStill, I think itas more instructive to turn the question around. If I wereA a fan of the Timberwolves, and Flip Saunders sent Love to Cleveland without getting Wiggins in return, Iad storm the Wolves practice facility and burn it to the ground.\n Is Daryl Morey secretly overrated? Whoas had the better career, Tom Hanks or Tom Cruise? Jay Z or Kanye? Should you let your kids play football? Would we all be better off if theA Internet didnat exist? Has Barack Obamaas presidency been successful? These are debates. Reasonable people can argue both sides.\nWas David Kahn secretly underrated? J. Cole or Kanye? Is that bookcase talking to you right now? Should Barack Obama be arrested for treason? These are not debates.\nItas not a debate if one side of the argument is just crazy people.\nThatas how I feel about the aShould the Cavs trade Wiggins for Love?a question. If we talk about it long enough it may seem like a real question, but this should never get that far.\nAs good as everyone hopes Wiggins will be one day, Love is that good right now. I understand that playing with LeBron gives Wiggins a much better chance of maxing out all of his potential, and itas something everyone wants to see. I even understand the people who think Wiggins could help extend LeBronas prime the way Kawhi Leonard did with Tim Duncan. But letas not be crazy.\nThereas no way Minnesotaas doing a deal with Cleveland that doesnat include Wiggins, and if thatas the case, the Cavs absolutely have to include Wiggins and get the deal done.\nLeBronas 29 years old. The East is wide open. Even if you think Wiggins will be a star aA I think he will a it probably wonat happen for another three or four years, at which point the East will probably be tougher, LeBron will be older, and thereas a chance the Cavs will have wasted three years of LeBron with no titles, while the entire city of Cleveland gets a little more anxious every year.\nWhy make it complicated? Donat give the Warriors a chance to come to their senses and offer Thompson. Love and LeBron would be diabolical right this second. The passing alone would make them the most entertaining team on earth. They wouldnat even need three other players. Just let them run a two-man weave on the entire league.\nThink about it this way: What do other teams want the Cavs to do? Teams could take their chances the next few years against LeBron and Kyrie with a bunch of young guys and broken-down veterans trying to fill in the gaps around them. Or they couldA spend the next five years facing a new superteam with Love, LeBron, and Kyrie, three superstars smack in the middle of their primes, with less pressure on the young guys and a new cast of veterans signing on every summer. Iam sure itas tough for Cleveland fans to watch \n and imagine that player somewhere else, but come on. Donat overthink this. The biggest reason the Cavs should trade Wiggins for Love is because every team in the league is quietly praying theyare crazy enough not to."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/bill-simmons-romantic-comedy-or-sports-movie/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/kevin-love-lebron-james-trade-minnesota-timberwolves/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/2014-national-sports-collectors-convention/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nfl-the-league-that-never-takes-a-break/", "blog_text": "You probably know the 2014 NFL season kicks off in Seattle tonight, with Russell Wilson, Russell Wilsons unairbrushable loins and the defending champs laying six points to Aaron Rodgers and the Packers. Im excited to have Brady, Gronk, Belichick and every other Patriot back in my life. Im excited to see if I nailed this seasons sleeper (Tampa Bay!) and this seasons better-than-you-think contender (San Diego!). Im excited for Monday B.S. Reports with Cousin Sal, and Im excited to nearly quit fantasy football at least 200 times.\nGetting Sundays back ... that thrills me the most. I missed my wife glaring at me because its 6:30 p.m. and I havent showered yet. I missed yelling at my kids, \"YOU HAVE TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW!\" because they happened to stroll into the room right before a Stevan Ridley fumble. I missed keeping track of nine bets at the same time, I missed those moments when three killer games are wrapping simultaneously; and I missed hosting people for eight-hour, four-TV Sunday marathons highlighted by questions like, \"Should I pull up DirecTV on my iPad to get a fifth game going?\" \"Would it be weird if I ordered Indian-food takeout at 10:30 a.m.?\" and \"Should we switch seats just so we can say later that we moved?\"\nI love football. I missed football.\nStill, the coming season feels bittersweet because were saying farewell to the NFLs new and improved offseason. Normally, only 30 pro football weeks matter: the regular season through Super Bowl week, the first two free-agency weeks, NFL draft week, Hall of Fame week and the four season-ticket extortion weeks (a.k.a. the preseason). That leaves 22 NFL weeks that shouldnt matter at all, right?\nNot on Roger Goodells watch! His league just made professional sports history by dominating headlines, day in and day out, for 52 straight weeks. Sure, most of those stories were unflattering, perplexing, embarrassing, inappropriate or downright disturbing. Did Goodell even care? The league treated 2014s offseason the same way a celebrity might behave after his PR person tells him, \"Just remember, any publicity is good publicity.\" As weird as this sounds, it kinda sorta worked. We talked about the NFL the entire time.\nAnd somehow, Goodell escaped the spring and summer relatively unscathed, save for anyone still seething about his \n of Ray Rices situation. The commish needed five months to determine a verdict, then bungled that verdict so gravely that he (a) improbably offended every single type of football fan (especially female fans), (b) had to send team owners an after-the-verdict letter to apologize for screwing up the first verdict, and (c) speed-rushed a harsher domestic violence policy thats \n.\nWhen Keith Olbermann called for him to resign afterward, nobody even blinked. Were just used to Goodell now. I wouldnt call him a bad person, or a malicious one -- just someone who seems overmatched AND stubborn. Thats a toxic combination. There have been moments when Goodell made Gary Bettman look like the next Steve Jobs. Think about THAT for a second. So was Goodell overpromoted by one level? Is this hopeless? Is there any chance he will improve? Is this like being at a restaurant when theyre one waiter short and one of the bus boys has to take orders, only in this case, Goodell is the bus boy and the entire NFL is the restaurant?\nWhen you remember how terribly Goodell \n or the \n (remember, his old boss came back to clean it up!), its frightening to imagine how Goodell would have handled something infinitely more complicated like, say, the NBAs recent Donald Sterling quagmire. Even when Goodell belatedly tries to do the \"right\" thing -- abruptly changing the leagues \n without giving the players enough time to adjust, \n in a misguided attempt to prove that the league was getting safer, blowing this summers aforementioned Ray Rice fiasco, or waiting nearly six months to announce this weeks inevitably controversial Jim Irsay suspension -- Goodell always seems to be reacting instead of acting. Not the most flattering trait for the leader of Americas biggest sport.\nBut as long as hes making money for the 32 NFL owners, theyre happy. And theyre all making money. Of course, if Goodell were a political incumbent running for reelection, the opposing candidate would be hammering him with attack ads like these.\n\"As the commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell taught us a lot of lessons over the years - you know, like that its eight and a half times worse to smoke pot three different times than it is to drag your just-knocked-her-unconscious fiancee out of an elevator like a prehistoric caveman. ROGER GOODELL -- RUNNING THE NFL INTO THE GROUND.\"\n\"Roger Goodell looks the other way when his players miraculously gain 30 pounds of muscle. Roger Goodell looks the other way when his players return from a nine-month injury in three months. Roger Goodell looks the other way when his players retire and immediately lose 50 pounds in eight weeks. Roger Goodell looks the other way as the controversy over the Redskins name becomes a national story. ROGER GOODELL -- THE MAN WHO LOOKS THE OTHER WAY.\"\n\"Roger Goodell and NFL owners claim they didnt know concussions were serious health risks until 2009, and they didnt do anything resembling a reasonable policy until a year later. In \n, Billy Bob battles concussion issues so severe that he ends up crippling Lance Harbor. When was that movie made? 1999! ROGER GOODELL -- THE GUY WHO PRETENDS THAT HES NEVER SEEN A SPORTS MOVIE.\"\n\"Roger Goodell made $44 million last year. We cant even come up with a good enough attack ad for this. Were just gonna keep saying this over and over again. Roger Goodell made $44 million last year. Roger Goodell made $44 million last year. Roger Goodell made $44 million last year. ROGER GOODELL -- HE MADE $44 MILLION LAST YEAR.\"\nFortunately for Goodell, its nearly impossible for a sports commissioner to lose his job with a successful league. (Just look at Bud Selig -- hes hanging on to his gig through next January even though hes nearly four times older than Mike Trout.) And to Goodells credit, he has four things going for him right now.\nFirst, his multi-scene cameo in \n was fantastic. I loved his chemistry with Frank Langella. What a masterful use of the commishs time -- to guarantee himself a four-month shelf life of cameos on airplane VOD screens as his league was crumbling morally around him. (Fine, Im kidding about all of this -- I just wanted to make fun of \n. Although its probably not a coincidence that Goodells biggest Hollywood moment came in a frustrating football movie that yielded not one, not two, but THREE of the most indefensible logic mistakes in sports movie history.)\nSecond, Goodells NFL keeps thriving financially despite the steady stream of big-picture mistakes, general callousness, conflicting policies and head-scratching insensitivity. When you think about it, Jerry Jones is the quintessential NFL owner right now -- he cant stop making money despite himself. His Cowboys are worth a record $3.2 billion right now because of the brand, the stadium, the city and the uniforms. Thats it. The guy could tumble out of his luxury suite in a drunken stupor and miraculously have his fall broken by a bed of $100 bills. Thats the NFL in 2014 and it happened on Goodells watch. I think thats a compliment.\nThird, I cant remember a bigger disparity between \"how mainstream media members pretend the commissioner is doing\" and \"how a commissioner is actually doing.\" Goodell spent the past eight years buttering these dudes and ladies up like three-pound lobsters; its probably his no. 1 accomplishment. And it keeps paying off. I cant remember another commissioner manipulating the media better, actually. So ... theres that!\nAnd fourth, as we mentioned earlier, Goodell achieved the impossible: He finally transformed the NFL into a 52-week sport. Fifty-two weeks of legitimate headlines! For the same sport!\nWho knew a league could yield that much mileage out of PED suspensions, failed drug tests, domestic disputes, fights, arrests and other sordid fodder for the ESPN Ticker-TMZ-Sports Blog-Twitter Moral Majority era? Who knew we could drag five solid months of headlines out of \n? Who knew the same league could juggle this many lawsuits? Who knew so many key players could be suspended for the same opening week? Who knew so many decisions could NOT make sense, and that wed have so much fun complaining about how they didnt make sense? Who knew we could love a league when the answer to the question, \"Does the NFL truly and honestly care about its players and its former players?\" seems to be so clearly, \"Not really, no\"?\nYou never stopped thinking about the NFL in 2014. The league was always kind of lingering. And sure, you could say the same thing about the stench of a corpse. But if Goodells goal was to keep growing the NFL at the expense of just about everything else, it worked. I dont know a single football fan who quit the NFL this season, and neither do you. We care just as much as we always did. We look the other way as much as we always did.\nIt reminds me a little of Louis C.K.s riff on the history of slavery from his 2013 HBO special.\nRisky topic, right? He pulled it off in the setup by making sure that we KNOW slavery was the worst thing that humanity ever produced. He bangs that point home for 20 solid seconds, just so he doesnt lose us with whats coming next.\n\"Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves,\" C.K. says. \"Every single thing where you go, How did they build those pyramids? They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. ... Theres no end to what you can do when you dont give a f-- about particular people.\"\nThat looks harsher in print than it does when a talented comedian is saying it. (Thats why I included the embedded video.) But C.K. finishes the riff (and the show itself) by holding up his iPhone and asking, \"Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because [in] the factory where theyre making these, THEY JUMP OFF THE F--ING ROOF because its a nightmare in there. You really have a choice -- you can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other, or let someone suffer immeasurably [from] far away just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube as youre taking a shit.\"\nThats just a great rant. And even if its not remotely as bad for NFL players (obviously), that same dissociative quality prevails for NFL fans. We just want to watch football. We put up with everything else. Its just in the way.\nWe dont care that Josh Gordon will probably lose a year of his professional career because he would have been better off popping 10 Toradols a day instead of puffing two different joints.\nWe dont care that my generation grew up dreaming about playing in the NFL, only now, those same people are raising a new generation of kids that either (a) arent being allowed to play football for safety reasons, (b) are being allowed to play football, but only after lots of soul-searching and flip-flopping by the parents (an evolving process), (c) play football because its a potential escape from whatever place theyre trying to leave, or (d) play football in a town or city that lives and dies with football and wouldnt have it any other way. Theres no right answer, but its infinitely more complicated than it used to be. Are these role models? Do we want our kids to grow up like them? When Sundays roll around, we dont really care.\nWe dont care that the league claims to care about player safety, but its still cranking out that debilitating Thursday-night schedule and forcing teams to grind out two games in five days.\nWe dont care that the league doesnt seem to realize that, if it made an HONEST effort to clean up football from a painkiller-PED-steroid standpoint, theres a chance we wouldnt have as many concussions (because the players wouldnt be quite as fast and strong) or as many off-field incidents (because the players wouldnt be hormone yo-yos).\nWe dont care that Wes Welker should retire right now, that theres absolutely no way he should play football again after his last concussion, that hes a 2022 \n segment waiting to happen ... and yet you know hell be out there in Week 6.\nWe care about what happened with Ray Rice, and how it was handled ... but not nearly enough to stop watching football, right?\nAnd thats why the National Football League remains Americas true pastime, a reality that reflects our own faults more than we want to admit. The leagues ongoing prosperity will be battling an accompanying (and undeniable) shelf life as science evolves and our society evolves. Its an end game of sorts. We can see it now. Its an invisible seesaw that will tip over the NFL, eventually, whether its 15 years from now, 30 years from now, or after Im dead. But its coming. And we know it.\nFor now? The league is fine. Tonights must-see battle in Seattle will invariably fetch a bigger rating than last years opener. Get ready for a four-hour entertainment extravaganza. Well hear about the cat-and-mouse matchup between Seattles defense and Green Bays offense. Well hear about Eddie Lacy making The Leap. Well hear about Aaron Rodgers dating Olivia Munn. Well hear that Percy Harvin is Seattles X-factor. Well hear that theres something just special about Russell Wilson, and that Richard Sherman is a better guy than we realize. Well hear about Seattles historically loud crowd, well see some indecipherable decibel meter that wont make sense because none of us understand the decibel scale, and well definitely hear that Green Bays rookie center \"could be in for a rough night.\"\nAnd at some point, its going to feel like real football again. I cant wait. Im picking the Seahawks minus-6 and adopting them for three hours. Im starting Harvin, Stephen Hauschka and Seattles D on my West Coast fantasy team. Im teasing the Hawks with the Bears on Sunday. Im even picking Seattle to become only the third back-to-back Super Bowl champ of the past 20 years. The NFL season officially starts tonight, but really, it never stops. Thanks to Roger Goodell, it runs for 365 days a year. Give that man another raise."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/2014-nfl-gambling-guide/", "blog_text": "Football, football, football, football!\nFOOTBALL!!!!!!!!\nIf you missed my Thursday column about Roger Goodells NFL That Never Sleeps (featuring my winning Seahawks minus-6 pick!), \n.\nIf you want to send along a mailbag question for my Friday NFL Picks column this season (and Im going to need good ones as always), \n.\nIf you want to listen to my Guess the Lines podcasts with Cousin Sal every Monday, \n.\nIf you want to make fun of my five weekly LVH Supercontest Picks on my Facebook page, \n.\nIf you want to pick games against me, Ian Ziering, David Hasselhoff, Gary Busey, Mark McGrath and other well-known celebs in the 2014 Celebrity Picks Challenge Presented by Fireball Whisky, \n.\nHeres the good news: My Friday picks column is now old enough to vote for president, fight for our country and maybe even be someones freshman roommate in college. Thats right ... its Year 18. And you think so little of me at this point that you clicked on the link in the previous paragraph. Now you have that detestable \"Rude\" song running through your head for the rest of the day. And you deserve it. I thought we had something. I hope you feel bad.\nAnyway, way back in September of 1997, I was living in Boston and writing for my self-created \"Bostons Sports Guy\" website for millions and millions of readers. Fine, it was hundreds and hundreds. But that was the year I unleashed my first batch of mostly mediocre picks on an unsuspecting America. Its been trial and error ever since. Mostly error. \n before eventually settling for the Gambling Manifesto Thats In My Head.\nWhy abandon a tried-and-true manifesto? I learned the hard way that football changes too much from year to year to survive too many enduring rules. For instance, the gambling gods conspired in 2013 to ruin everyone who fancied himself a handicapping expert. Every sharp and every degenerate will remember the devastating Great Gambling Train Wreck of 2013 years and years from now, the same way well remember earthquakes, political scandals and unauthorized \n movies. My B.S. Report buddy and future Gamblers Anonymous roommate, Cousin Sal, recently sent me \n from \n. The three most relevant quotes from that piece, along with my notes in parentheses.\n\"In 2013, NFL favorites covered the spread at a 52.2 percent clip, the highest rate since 2005 and the third highest in the last 25 years ... since 1990, NFL favorites covered an average of just 48.7 percent of games.\"\n(Thats bad. Thats very, very, very bad. Every \"smart\" gambler is trained to grab the points and go against the public as much as we possibly can. Thats how we butter our bread. Swing our luck by 3.5 percentage points and were in major trouble ranging from \"Crap, I have to reload my off-shore betting account for the third time this month?\" to \"If I dont meet some guy named Big Al in the parking lot behind Target on Main Street by 7:30 on Wednesday night, Im gonna be walking with a limp.\")\n\"(For) seasons in which NFL favorites covered more than 51.5 percent (since 1990) ... the average for those five seasons was 53.3 percent. In years following those seasons (highlighted in green), favorites covered, on average, just 47 percent of games. Thats a 6.3 percent swing (from 53.3 percent to 47 percent).\"\n(Wait, this is good! Is that why \n made the real headline for this column \"The Year of the Dog\"? I think it is!)\n\"In 2006, the year after the best NFL season for favorites in the last 25 years (57.8 percent of favorites covered in 2005), dogs ruled, with favorites covering just 44.6 percent. After the second best season for favorites (52.9 percent in 1998), dogs again cleaned up, as favorites went just 46.5 percent ATS. The third best year for NFL favorites was last season.\"\n(Translation: Year of the Dog, Part Three!!!!!!!)\nSo lets make that one of our 2014 rules: \"When in doubt, always, always, ALWAYS take the points.\"\nSome other rules that I plan on abiding by in 2014 ...\nThis years group of shaky QBs in no particular order: EJ Manuel-Kyle Orton; Geno Smith; Johnny Football; Jake Locker Unless He Shows Us Something Early; Chad Henne; Ryan Fitzpatrick; Derek Carr-Matt Schaub; Matt Schaub A Second Time; Robert Griffin III (sorry, D.C. fans, but its true and you know it); Tony Romo During Any Week In Which Hes Just Had An Epidural; Matt Cassel; Shaun Hill; Carson Palmer; Just About Any Shaky Backup.\nNot on that list for now: Brian Hoyer (Im a semi-fan); Josh McCown (Im a believer); Kirk Cousins (Im a fan); Teddy Bridgewater (Im a HUGE fan); Blake Bortles or Derek Carr Unless Theyre Playing Somewhere Scary Like Seattle (I dont mind either of them); and Jimmy Garoppolo (my sons first future football hero).\nWell, unless you have an amazing reason on the level of \"\n just put Aaron Rodgers on the cover holding 10 black cats while standing under a ladder and posing with his new girlfriend \n.\"\nWe have a 13-year Belichick-Brady track record at this point. In the situation I just described, they are 97,567-2 against the spread (all numbers approximate).\nWhether its some allegedly hot team coming off a big win, the team that just looked awesome on Sunday or Monday night, the team that every \"expert\" is picking on Thursday and Friday, the most obvious candidate for your Eliminator Pool (like Chicago at home against Buffalo this week), or the team thats getting picked 85 percent of the time on ESPNs Pigskin Pickem. Every week -- repeat: EVERY WEEK -- theres always one Obvious Pick. Just be careful.\nLike the Jets laying five to Oakland in Jersey this week. When your brain is turned off, you lay the points, right? Who the hell would take Derek Carr and the Raiders on the road? But turn your brain on for a second ... should that crappy Jets team be favored by five against ANYONE? Does home-field advantage matter when youre getting booed because youre down 17-0 in the second quarter and it looks like Tom Cruise could start at cornerback for you? Why are the Jets such an \n pick there?\nPicking double-digit spreads is like having a 12 against a two in blackjack -- theres no right answer, but youre better off doing the same thing every time. In 2014, I plan on grabbing the points unless its a breathtaking scenario along the lines of \"The Seahawks just lost last week, theyre pissed off, and now Carson Palmer is coming to Seattle and hes starting even though he might have a torn rotator cuff.\"\nYou should approach every tease with this mind-set: I would feel totally comfortable betting my life on this if it wouldnt be so bizarre to bet your life on a two-team football tease. I already broke this rule in Week 1 when I teased Seattle -6 (already covered) with Chicago -7.5 at home against Buffalo (looks sooooooooo easy on paper and I did it anyway). When Jay Cutler limps out of the game in the second quarter, blame me. Its my fault.\nDuring a typical gambling season, home dogs will cover somewhere around 58-60 percent of the time. But during the Great Gambling Train Wreck of 2013? Home dogs started out hot as always (17-11 over the first five weeks), then free-fell into a fiery hell (25-34-2 over the next 12 weeks). Again, we have a solid amount of evidence that 2014 might be the Year of the Dog. I dont need to spell this out for you.\nI broke that strategy down in 2004s award-winning \n -- for instance, I love San Diego as 2014s surprise 12-win contender, Tampa Bay as 2014s \"Nobody Believes In Us\" sleeper, Baltimore as 2014s comeback team, Cincy as 2014s Slightly Undervalued Contender, and Minnesota as 2014s super-frisky non-playoff team. Im also waaaaaaaaay down on Carolina and Kansas City; I think the Falcons, Cardinals and Jets are worse than people think; Im petrified of the QB situations in Buffalo, Houston and Washington; and Im worried that San Francisco might have a Year From Hell Season. Throughout September, I am sticking to my guns -- thats how I feel, so thats how I am picking games with those teams.\nWrite it down! YEAR OF THE DOG!!!!!!!!! Got it?\nBefore we hit the rest of the Week 1 picks, I wanted to mention my \"circle\" theory that I keep bringing up in podcasts but havent properly explained in print. We dont have legitimate NFL juggernauts along the lines of the early-90s Cowboys anymore; the Salary Cap Era makes it impossible. By January, every playoff team just hopes they became one of the seven or eight contenders with a \n to win the Super Bowl.\nThink of it this way: You always leave an NBA season saying, \"The best team clearly won,\" with very few exceptions (2013 and 1988 being the most recent). You always leave an NFL season saying, \"One of the best teams caught a few breaks, took care of business and deserved to win.\" Most of it makes sense, but not all of it: the Helmet Catch, Rahim Moore, Kyle Williams, Santonio Holmes dragging his feet ... I mean, in the words of Tony DAmato, it really is a game of inches.\nSo you want to break into that January circle. Seven contenders usually do it, then theres always that eighth late bloomer/sleeper/surprise team that unexpectedly crashes the party. Well call that team the Wonk Team, since things always get wonky as soon as the Wonk Team reveals itself. Check out how the last seven seasons played out. (Teams got two asterisks if they won the Super Bowl and one asterisk if they lost the Super Bowl.)\n Denver (13-3, alpha dog),* Seattle (13-3),** New England (12-4), San Francisco (12-4), Carolina (12-4), New Orleans (11-5), Cincy (11-5), San Diego (Wonk Team).\n Denver (13-3, alpha dog), Atlanta (13-3), New England (12-4), Houston (12-4), San Francisco (11-4-1),* Seattle (11-5), Green Bay (11-5), Baltimore (Wonk Team).**\n Green Bay (15-1, alpha dog), New England (13-3),* New Orleans (13-3), San Francisco (13-3), Baltimore (12-4), Pittsburgh (12-4), Houston (10-6), NY Giants (Wonk Team).**\n New England (14-2, alpha dog), Atlanta (13-3), Pittsburgh (12-4),* Baltimore (12-4), New Orleans (11-5), NY Jets (11-5), Chicago (11-5), Green Bay (Wonk Team).**\n Indy (14-2, alpha dog),* New Orleans (13-3),** San Diego (13-3), Minnesota (12-4), Dallas (11-5), Green Bay (11-5), Arizona (10-6), NY Jets (Wonk Team).\n Tennessee (13-3, alpha dog), Carolina (12-4), Pittsburgh (12-4),** NY Giants (12-4), Indy (12-4), Baltimore (11-5), Philly (9-6-1), Arizona (Wonk Team).*\n New England (16-0, alpha dog),* Green Bay (13-3), Dallas (13-3), Indy (13-3), San Diego (11-5), Jacksonville (11-5), Seattle (10-6), NY Giants (Wonk Team).**\nFrom 2007 through 2013, the alpha dog made three Super Bowls and lost all three ... and the Wonk Team won four Super Bowls and lost a fifth. That makes no sense whatsoever, but it also makes SOME sense if you believe that (a) the \"Nobody Believes In Us\" factor matters way more than we realize, and (b) the NFL playoffs are a freaking crapshoot.\nHeres what my 2014 circle looks like: Im locking down Seattle (my 2014 guess: 14-2), New England (12-4), Denver (12-4), San Diego (11-5), New Orleans (11-5) and Cincy (11-5) as my six true contenders. The seventh contender: the NFC North champ (Green Bay or Chicago are both going 10-6 and it will come down to the 17th tiebreaker). And for the Wonk Team, lets go with either Green Bay (if its a wild card) or A Team Coached By A Harbaugh Brother. Thats right, San Francisco and Baltimore -- Im looking at one of you to get your wonk on.\nOne more note: I dont think San Francisco AND Green Bay will make the playoffs. At gunpoint, Id say Green Bay is in, San Fran is out ... and Baltimore will be the Wonk Team. My other three playoff teams: Tampa, Indy and Philly. So there you go.\nWhy didnt I decide on a Wonk Team to win it all? I believe the Seahawks are talented enough and hungry enough to become our third back-to-back champs since 1994. Unlike so many other defending champs, they didnt lose three or four key free agents; they didnt get fleeced of their slightly overqualified assistant coaches; they didnt have to overpay any of their Super Bowl heroes; and they actually might be more explosive than last season because of Russell Wilson (edging closer and closer to his prime) and Percy Harvin (finally healthy). They have the best home-field advantage in any sport. And best of all, everyone writes off defending champs for all the reasons mentioned earlier -- we just assume the NFL is too much of a crapshoot, and that youre never getting that lucky twice.\nYou know what? Thats awesome for the Seahawks. In a weird way, theyre almost the \"Nobody Believes In Us\" champs. I have them beating my beloved Patriots in the Super Bowl, followed by four straight months of my dad complaining, \"I cant believe Pete F - - -ing Carroll just beat us in the Super Bowl.\"\nLets quickly rip through the Week 1 picks ...\n\n\n They cant make the spread for next weeks Jets-at-Packers game high enough for me.\n\nLove grabbing the Saints in any dome, love going against the overvalued Falcons this early. Meanwhile, I know Rembert Browne already covered Bryan Coxs taste in movies in \n, as Cox dropped gems like \"I like to watch \n and movies like that,\" \"Adam Sandler movies -- I like any movie he put out, Im going\" and \"\n is the best movie out in the last five years, I think.\" But one Cox quote stuck out for me:\nI like the movies that, when you go to the newspaper, and look at the review, they got three stars. Cause those damn people dont know what the hell they be talking about. I wanna go see them movies, I dont want to go see the ones for the Academy Awards. Them some boring-ass movies. I dont want to see them movies. Too serious. I dont want to see them movies. I got enough stress in my life to go watch some more stressful shit. I dont want to see that.\nCan you really say hes wrong? For Bryan Cox, movies are an escape from the stressful shit of real life. He doesnt want the realism of Mark Wahlberg fighting for his life on a Middle Eastern mountain in the most realistic war movie since \n; he wants to see Morris Chestnut improbably deliver his friends baby in the backseat of a car in \n, then step out of that same car with no blood or placenta gook whatsoever on his hands, slap those unsullied hands together and stick them in his pockets. He wants to see Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore take their respective kids on a $100,000 African vacation; HE DOESNT CARE that this trip was improbably given to them by Sandlers boss for reasons that remain unclear.\nYou know what? My kids dont care, either. They love Sandlers movies. They dont want any stressful shit in their lives, either. I think Bryan Cox is on to something. After the NFL season is over, I want to hire him for Grantland and send him to whatever the opposite of Sundance is.\n\nGood luck taking the Ravens against Cincys D when theyre running the ball for 1.7 yards a carry. By the way, the funniest moment of every fantasy draft this year was the 35 seconds after someone took Ray Rice -- millions of times around America, someone talked themselves into it, said the name \"Ray Rice,\" endured the immediate post-pick ribbing from everyone else in the room, realized they just made the all-time bad fantasy football karma move, then spent the next 15 minutes with the Mike Myers \"Uh-Oh, Kanye Is Going Off The Script\" Face. I wouldnt have taken Ray Rice in a 100-round draft, but thats just me.\n\nLaying the points while acknowledging the following red flags: Bears fans are secretly about 38 percent too confident about this Bears season even if theyd never admit it; Chicagos defense couldnt be a bigger candidate for giving up a garbage-time TD cover; the Bears are Week 1s A-list candidate to murder hundreds of thousands of two-team teasers, three-team teasers and eliminator pools.\n(And with all of that said ... you get to go against a head coach who screamed \"GO AHEAD AND FIRE ME!\" at team officials \n, as well as a starting QB who has looked so shaky that his team just panic-dropped $11 million over two years on Kyle Orton. Take a deep breath and lay the points.)\n\nBetween the never-ending name controversy, the whole \"Wait, Jay Gruden is the HEAD coach?\" thing and the whole everyone-knows-Cousins-is-better-than-Griffin not-quite-a-controversy-thats-about-to-become-a-controversy, Im forced to lay points with Ryan Fitzpatrick. It didnt feel great until my buddy House (die-hard D.C. fan) sent me this Gruden email:\nHeres the problem with the racist-skins: Jay Gruden appears to be an (expletive) nincompoop. Impossibly small sample-size obviously, but I dont like his behavior vis-a-vis command of the team, decision-making or ability to adapt to the teams real-time needs as they develop in games & over the course of the season, his demeanor, how he talks, the way he interacts with the media, the way he interacts with the players or the clothes he wears. Other than that, I think hes awesome.\n\nHad the Jets and Steelers penciled in until I did the \"Wait, are we sure ... ?\" routine on them. Meanwhile, heres Week 1s WTF of the Week: Did you know CBS assigned Jim Nantz and Phil Simms to the Raiders-Jets game? Did they secretly get demoted? Are they being punished? Did they just want to see if Simms snapped after watching two hours of Geno Smith and Derek Carr? Did they forget the Pats were playing in Miami? Did Nantz have great U.S. Open seats for the mens final that he didnt want to give up? Did the guy running CBS football suffer a head injury and mistakenly think it was 1968? WTF???\nYou could have talked me into the Titans as this years Improbable Wild Card Just Because Of Their Cream Puff Schedule if you bought me two more drinks. Hey, if you had to make a gambling spread for \"Number of playoff wins for the 2014 Royals\" versus \"Number of wins for the 2014 Chiefs,\" what would it be? I think its \"Chiefs minus-2.\" And Im taking the Royals. (Uh-oh, \n is keeled over his computer keyboard right now -- somebody call the paramedics!!!!!!!!!)\n\nI always loved the parallels between the Spurs and Pats -- pounded out a steady excellence that peaked in the first part of the last decade, kept cranking out high-quality seasons because of the Brady-Belichick and Duncan-Pop infrastructure, kept hanging around, suffered some bad beats, kept hanging around, and now theyre still contending all these years later. The 2013-14 NBA season became The Last Great Duncan-Pop Season, as you know. Hoping well say the same about the 2014 NFL season for Brady and Belichick. Its certainly the best defense theyve had in 10 years. Stay tuned.\n\n12 against a 2 ... HIT ME! Meanwhile, heres the funniest/angriest email of Week 1, courtesy of Stephen in Glendale, CA:\nBill, let me start off by saying I was watching the Ellen Degeneres show a couple days ago because I was stoned and couldnt find the remote. It occurred to me that you and Ellen could be brother and sister. Youre both very successful with Anglo-Saxon features and have both overcome life obstacles, her coming out and you being exceedingly mediocre. In any case, as a Jaguar fan, Ive put up with a lot in the past few years. Everything from having to watch Blaine Gabbert try and take on a pass rush to Blaine Gabbert generally existing. When Justin Blackmon was drafted, I thought we had an All-Pro caliber player, but instead we got an All-Pro [\n]. Last year, we started 0-8 but ended the year 4-4, a finish that I felt was something to be built on. We even had a great draft. So, upon seeing that Mays and Barnwell had their \n, I stupidly thought \"Hey, heres a chance to hear some optimism about the Jaguars.\" I sat through a half-hour of Andrew Luck talk before Mays asked Barnwell, \"So what do you think the Jaguars will be good at and Barnwell responded \"Scoreboard.\" I hate you Bill Simmons and your Jaguar hating cronies. I hate you all. Youll see what happens when the Bortles generation starts, Justin Blackmon finds Jesus, and the Jaguars go 7-9 this year and 11-5 next year. I mean, the defense that just ripped the Broncos to shreds in the playoffs was constructed by the dude that is currently head coaching our team! You and your smug colleagues can go to Hell.\n\nThis week, I participated in an excellent NFL wins pool (\n) in which I ended up with the third, 13th and 30th picks. Seattle and New England went 1-2, so I grabbed Denver at no. 3. I took Tampa over Baltimore at no. 13 as my higher-ceiling gamble. And at no. 30, improbably, I had the Vikings and Rams on the board (with the not-improbable Raiders). My pick? The Vikings! And heres why ...\n* I already thought Sam Bradford was going to undermine a talented Rams team, so even if Shaun Hill ends up being 80 percent as good as Bradford (a realistic bet since Bradford was never that good), thats a super-size undermine.\n* I actually like this Vikes team. Ideally, they win this game, blow three of the next four, then Bridgewater steps in and they make a belated playoff run. Lots of weapons, new outdoor stadium under construction, Mike Zimmer, All-Day, great 2014 draft, Teddy with a chip on his shoulder ... sign me up. In December, when the Vikes are 9-6 and Dallas is 2-13, well be laughing about how Adrian Peterson wanted to be a Cowboy. Seriously. Well have a nice collective guffaw about it.\n\nMy dream Week 1 matchup: my favorite still-undervalued team playing at home against 2014s no. 1 regression candidate. Actually, this game is like a hot blackjack table. Just shut up. Dont celebrate, dont brag, dont count your chips, dont taunt the pit boss, dont say anything.\n\nBooooooooooooooooo!\nBoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nThree quick notes here: I have Kaepernick on both fantasy teams and cant wait to trade him right after his 49-point performance in this game; I agree with Bill Barnwell that \n; and Jason Garretts +200 \"First Coach Fired\" odds is the single best NFL wager on the board right now. I look forward to the Niners throwing everyone off their possibly rancid Year From Hell scent with a blowout victory in this one. So many red flags. Well tackle this next week.\nMeanwhile, heres the funniest idea of Week 1, courtesy of Luke Peacock in Jacksonville:\nI went to college in Dallas and almost all of my friends from there are Cowboys fans. After another 8-8 season, I persuaded my most passionate Cowboy fan friend to start a \"league\" called The Cowboy Dismount, where we get 16 disillusioned Cowboys fans to agree to stop supporting the Cowboys and be assigned two new NFL teams to root for (one NFC, one AFC). Theres a buy-in fee, and at the end of the season, whoevers team wins the Super Bowl gets 60% of the pot, and whoevers team gets the top pick in next years draft gets 40% of the pot. The person who gets randomly assigned the Cowboys has to pay an extra buy-in as a form of punishment for continuing to support the most mediocre team in sports.\nWe did the draft last week and people are legitimately excited to not have to root for the Cowboys anymore. \n. Enjoy!\n(Ladies and gentlemen, your 2014 Dallas Cowboys!!!!)\n\n\"Manning in a night game\" plus \"Denver giving less than eight at home\" plus \"Indy isnt that good to begin with\" definitely outweighs \"Is there anything worse than rooting against Andrew The Giant as hes driving for a spread-busting, garbage-time TD?\" But I dont feel great about it. Just throw Denver into a tease and thank me later.\n\nTampas Lovie Smith was this years best W.A.R.M. candidate for my \"Wins Above Raheem Morris\" stat -- thats the \"metric\" that covers the statistically incalculable upgrade from an incompetent coach to a competent coach. Hes a big reason why I like the 2014 Bucs. Lovie Smiths teams always compete and play terrific defense. Had Detroit hired him, I would have picked Detroit to go 11-5.\nYou know whos NOT a W.A.R.M. candidate? Jim Caldwell ... a.k.a. This Decades Art Shell. This will not end well.\n\nWait a second ... theres a second Week 1 game pitting an Undervalued 2014 Team That I Love against Another Obvious Regression Candidate? And Im GETTING points? I love the Year of the Dog so much that Im posting a picture of my dog. Lets do this, Rufus."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/roger-goodell-need-to-step-down/", "blog_text": "My Thursday-night pick: Baltimore -2.5 over Pittsburgh. Who cares? Does ANYONE care? Lets break out the special-edition \"HOW THE HELL DOES ROGER GOODELL STILL HAVE A JOB?\" mailbag!\nBut first ... how the hell does Roger Goodell still have a job?\nSeriously ... how the hell does Roger Goodell still have a job?\nIn all caps ... HOW THE HELL DOES ROGER GOODELL STILL HAVE A JOB?\nIn bolded, italicized caps ... \nOne more time ...\nMy answers: I dont know, I dont know, I dont know, I seriously dont know, and I cant f- - - ing figure it out (I dont know).\nIts official: Roger Goodell is the worst sports commissioner of my lifetime.\nThats something I nearly included in \n, ultimately deciding that it might be too harsh. Its not too harsh. Hes the worst. Hes worse than anyone in the original Lousy Commish Mount Rushmore: Fay Vincent, John Ziegler, Larry OBrien and early Gary Bettman. Hes worse than whoever ran the NASL into the ground. Hes worse than Vince McMahon during that one XFL season. Hes worse than William Regal. (Inside joke for the WWE nerds.) Hes worse than the guys who ran the WFL, USFL and MISL (three leagues that no longer exist).\nGoodell made history this week -- for me, anyway -- by becoming the first major sports commissioner ever to inspire me to say, \"Doesnt this feels like Nixon all over again?\" How can the same scandal blow up in someones face THREE DIFFERENT TIMES? Its impossible!\nBut this is America and people love going against the grain. I assumed that I would find at least a couple of reader emails that either defended Goodell or halfheartedly tried to make a case for him.\nI was wrong. I didnt find one.\nAs always, these are actual emails from actual readers.\nBS: First, they actually cared about finding the secret elevator tape ... unlike the NFL, which clearly didnt care even though every inch of a casino is being filmed by a camera at all times. Goodell maintaining that the NFL \"kept asking for the tapes\" is right out of the dog-ate-my-homework school of bullshit that we learned to see through about 40 years ago. Seriously, just stop. Youre insulting us.\nSecond, TMZ probably realized that Revel Casino was going out of business over Labor Day weekend, which meant its about-to-be-unemployed workers had nothing to lose by selling the tape. Why didnt the NFL anticipate the same thing? Because its obviously Jackass Central over there. Thats the only explanation. You know why I didnt know Revel Casino was going under two weekends ago? Because I live in L.A., and because Im not running a professional sports league that was one resurfaced mystery tape away from a crippling scandal. How did the NFL not know? And if they knew, how did they NOT get the tape? Whos the NFLs director of security, Brick Tamland?\nWhich leads me to my third reason why TMZ outdid Goodells league: Either the NFL is run by an overmatched commish who orders around a slew of lackeys and buffoons and never saw that day coming; they saw the tape but never expected it to come out; they watched the tape and then buried it (the most nefarious of all the scenarios, by far); they underestimated the impact of the tape (and then some); and/or they were outwitted by the one and only Harvey Levin. Whatever the answer, the NFL failed basic IQ standards here for seven months. It waited five months to give a verdict, botched it so horrendously that it had to create a loophole-filled domestic-violence policy on the fly, then redid the Rice verdict a second time when the second tape came out. Last time I checked, real life doesnt have a RESET button.\nThis wasnt Goodells first mega-screwup; were on no. 8 or no. 9 at this point. But its his most memorable botch job, and easily his most indefensible. He needs to go. Put the league in someone elses hands, please. We need the help.\nBS: So you dont have a ton of confidence in an \"independent\" investigation led by owners from two of the teams oldest-run families (the Maras and Rooneys) and \n that just helped the NFL negotiate a 10-figure deal with DirecTV? And you think maybe it doesnt look great that the current Ravens president (Dick Cass) spent 30 years working for that same law firm? Hold on, whats that smell?\n\n\nBS: Too soon to say. When an athlete gets a rule or innovation named after him, hes either being immortalized (like the Alcindor Rule, Gretzky Rule, Fosbury Flop, Hack-A-Shaq or even the (Larry) Bird rights) or he lucked out for being in the right place at the right time (the Trent Tucker Rule).\nRay Rice made a reprehensible choice, then his league \n reacted to that choice in the worst possible way. Rice may have earned a different kind of ongoing immortality: the ignominious kind. We will see.\n\n\nBS: The second video changed the conversation by eliminating any and all ambiguities, as the impact of those visual images incensed just about everyone. And it wasnt just the violence. Rice never reacted to the sight of his unconscious fiancee as if he were thinking, \n; more like, \n That video was appalling. Other than that, I agree with everything Erica wrote, especially this: \"The Ravens and NFL were willing to embrace the man right up until public opinion made that a bad business move.\"\nPerfect. Thats exactly what happened. And thats my biggest issue with Goodell -- its not just his tone deafness and his penchant for reacting instead of acting. Hes so freaking calculated. About everything. For eight years, hes handled his business like some father of a high school kid whos hosting a prom party, sees some unresponsive drunk kid sprawled across the bathroom floor, then thinks to himself, \n instead of \n He needs to go.\nBS: Probably all three. Max just came up with the perfect way to describe Goodell -- he really IS like a \n president. In other words, hes just realistic enough that you cant figure out if hes making these monster mistakes intentionally or unintentionally, only hes just unrealistic enough that you keep muttering to yourself, \"Wait, something just doesnt add up here.\" And you could definitely see him involved in a scene like this:\nJack (on his cell): \"Im in Atlantic City -- Roger, I JUST SAW THE TAPE!\"\n[\n]\nGoodell [\n]: \"What tape?\"\nJack: \"The tape! Ray Rice! The original elevator tape!\"\n[\n]\nRoger: Jack? I want you to un-see the tape.\nJack: What?\nRoger: Un-see the tape.\nJack: I CANT DO THAT!!!!!!!\nBS: Come on, ESPN would never run that show! We have standards! Sure, those standards dont include refraining from airing the (undeniably disturbing) elevator video on every ESPN network on and off for 72 solid hours even though we wouldnt run the Kevin Ware video, but hey, we have standards!\nBS: You just described why Goodell needs to resign before October 1. Or the NFL could keep him and change its name to the HFL (Hypocritical Football League). Its a coin flip.\n\n\nBS: I believe in second chances if the punishment has been served, and if the punished person made an honest attempt to turn his life around AND atone for his mistake. If you read \n (The Dooze) in 2009, you wouldnt have expected me to \n 20 months later. But Vick suffered an appropriate penalty for his crimes, showed the right level of remorse, changed his life for the better and even spent real time raising awareness about animal abuse. Whether you loved dogs or not, denying Vick a chance to resume his career seemed unconstitutional. So whats the appropriate penalty for Ray Rice? What should he do over these next 12 to 24 months to change his life? How will he demonstrate the proper level of remorse? How can he help raise awareness for domestic violence in a way that doesnt include the letters \"TMZ\"? That hasnt played out yet. Its too early to have an answer here.\n\n\nBS: I have \"drunk with power\" as a +250 underdog to \"stubborn and incompetent.\" But to answer your question, this was a big week for Spygate Truthers. I cant come up with a good comeback other than this one.\nBS: I mean ... youre not going to be worse, right? How many years have you run that fantasy league? Does everyone pay on time? When two owners get snippy on email, can you defuse it before someone quits the league? And are you smart enough to know that every casino elevator has cameras? You might be closer than you think.\n\n\nBS: I think well look back at the entire Goodell era that way (not just Rice) ... UNLESS the right commissioner takes over and starts quickly repairing the damage. And by the way? Dont rule that out. Following Goodell is gonna be like following the worst boyfriend ever -- you cant lose no matter what you do. Thats why Steve Ballmer paid $2 billion for the Clips, right? It wasnt just about the L.A. market or overpaying a little to join a hot league; Ballmer knew Clippers fans would love Anyone Not Named Sterling. Same logic goes for future NFL commish candidates. Terrific job, huge financial upside, huge social upside. So lets find someone! Maybe Adam Silver 2.0 is lurking out there. Speaking of ...\n\n\nBS: I love George -- he roots for an NBA team that lost the worlds best basketball player under mysterious circumstances, then miraculously won three of the next four lotteries. And now hes wondering if Adam Silver was involved in a DIFFERENT conspiracy? Cleveland fans are the best. (Just kidding, Adam! But seriously, how great does Adam Silver look right now? Is there any way in a million years that he wouldve handled the Rice fiasco even 12.5 percent as badly?)\n\n\nBS: And also, \"Were not gonna react unless theres a damaging video.\" Id throw that one in there, too. As Grantlands Andrew Sharp \n, Rice was initially suspended for two games, but Ray McDonald and Greg Hardy played in Week 1? Why didnt the league revisit its domestic-violence policy in 2012 after Javon Belchers horrific murder-suicide? Maybe its unfair to say that Goodell reacts instead of acts ... sometimes he doesnt react at all. (Unless hes trying to butter up a media member. I forgot.)\nBS: The guy who spent two weeks of his life making the \"Vince McMahon Says Youre Fired For 5 Minutes\" clip is devastated right now.\nBS: That point cant be banged home enough. Just last month, Dave Jacoby and I were riding an elevator at Encore Las Vegas, glanced up to the bubble camera over our heads and had the requisite, \"Where the hell is Ray Rices elevator video?\" conversation.\nAgain, Goodell spent five months figuring out a punishment after the initial Rice incident. None of his employees ever made the point, \"Its a freaking casino, that tape exists -- you have to find it before you dole out that penalty\"? Not one person said that? What about the APs report that someone in the NFLs office confirmed receiving the casinos tape, or OTLs report that Ray Rice absolutely admitted to Goodell, way back in June, \n? And how do we reconcile the fact that, back in July, two well-connected reporters (\n and \n) reported what NFL sources had told them happened in that second elevator video ... and they got the details correct? Now were supposed to believe nobody saw the tape? I mean, did they go to a f- - - ing psychic together? This whole thing is so insulting. We have to free Jack Bauer! He knows what happened!\n\n\nBS: My biggest takeaway was the \n (no pun intended).\nBS: I love waffles -- I cant give Goodell a nickname that makes me hungry. If you want to give him a derisive nickname, isnt it Roger Dodger?\nBS: Can you imagine what this mailbag would have looked like if I tried to defend Goodell with every answer? \nBS: Co-sign! Isnt this the kind of stuff we should be using \n for? Would Condi get 95 percent of the vote? 96 percent? 99 percent? Have I mentioned yet that Goodell needs to step down?\nBS: Ladies and gentlemen, the Roger Goodell Era!\nBS: One more time, lets hear it, ladies and gents ... put your hands together and salute the Roger Goodell Era!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBS: You left out \"I am not a crook,\" \"Lemme start by telling you this: I have never used steroids, period,\" \"Read my lips: no new taxes,\" \"I did not bet on baseball,\" \"Dont be ridiculous, it doesnt bother me at all that you did porn\" and \"the over/under for mailbags this summer is 3.5 -- take the over.\"\nBS: I thought about having Roger Goodell answer this question before realizing it would take him five months. So allow me to put on my serious Dad With A 9-Year-Old Daughter Who Doesnt Think ESPN Should Show The Elevator Video And Takes This Stuff Personally hat for a second: Just get rid of the Rice jersey. Buy a different one.\n\n\nBS: Thank you for the email. Coming Friday: my Week 2 picks. Like anyone cares."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-sports-guys-week-2-nfl-picks/", "blog_text": "If you missed last nightas Goodell-Must-Go bag, \n. Before we make Week 2 picks, allow me to congratulate myself for writing a Week 1 picks column called a\n,a imploring everyone to ride the underdogs all season ... then finishing 9-7 even though Week 1as underdogs went 11-5 against the spread. Congratulations to me. And you thought Iad be running out of ways to be an idiot by now.\nLetas look at Week 2 (home teams in caps) ...\n\nWinner! Or as weall remember that game from now on, the Goodell-Must-Go Bowl. \n My friend \n from my frenemy Le Batardas radio show in the now-defunct basketball capital of the world, Miami, Florida, raises an interesting suggestion: What if Goodell suspended himself before the owners had a chance to fire him? What if he announced on Monday, aI handled this abominably, I know it, and thatas why I am stepping away for six months and donating my salary for that time -- $22 million -- to help raise awareness for domestic violencea? Goodell could flip the narrative pretty quickly here, right? (Thinking.) Youare right, head never be smart enough to do that.\n\nTwo of Week 1as three aNobody Believes In Us!a teams (along with Carolina) battle in the seasonas first aNobody Believes In Us!a Bowl! I am making Buffaloas case by semi-plagiarizing two emails from Steve in Buffalo and Michael in England, just because I didnat want to waste space running similar emails. The Bills have an especially solid Week 2 case that includes the following variables:\n From Steve: aAfter 20 years of worrying about the L.A. Bills or Toronto Bills, new owner Terry Pegula put an end to that on Tuesday of this week. You know what this means to us and what it could mean to our city in the future. This is one of, if not the best, Buffalo sports weeks in 20 years.a Adds Michael, aIve heard numerous grown men cry on the radio this week, expressing through tears and words their gratitude that this beloved civic institution will not move to California or Canada.a Well, then.\n The aNobody Believes In Us!a variable is still there; the Bills arenat even favored AT HOME even though theyare getting one of the all-time bonkers Bills crowds on Sunday.\n Last December, Buffalo shut out the Dolphins 19-0 and tripled their numbers across the board, even though Miami needed that game for the playoffs and Buffalo was already done. (Translation: inner confidence!)\n We recentlyA found out that Jim Kelly miraculously jettisoned all the cancer from his body. Oh, and heas coming to Sundayas game. I wonder if this will fire up Buffaloas crowd.\n Ryan Tannehill on the road? (Cringing.) Fred Jackson at home? (Nodding.) And you KNOW Sammy Watkins is making one big play on Sunday -- my guess would be some catch in the corner of the end zone, in traffic, that ends with him continuing full speed and leaping into aA crowd of adoring Bills fans. I wish there wereA a way to wager on this.\nA Since Cleveland owns Buffaloas 2014 first-round pick, and since we cant rule out God deciding to re-hate Cleveland, I mean, doesnat this \n Buffaloas chances for becoming 2014as nobody-saw-it-coming playoff team? Why didnat I think of this a week ago? Buffalo 27, Miami 23.\n\nJust a classic Falcons performance last week -- Matt Ryan threw the crapA out of the ball, they kept fighting back against the Saints, Mike Smithas clock management was as hideous as ever, and it ended up being one of those anyone-could-have-won games. I think thatas their destiny; the Falcons are this yearas RedZone Channel Ending team. Grabbing the points only because of the overwhelming Garbage Time Touchdown Potential.\n\nR.I.P., every conversation about New Orleansas allegedly improved defense. Anyway, I screwed up last Sunday by going against all three home dogs in the Year of the Dog (and deservedly going 1-2). No more. From now on, Iam gravitating toward 2014as home dogs unless itas one of those aAustin Davis at home against Seattleas Daatype situations. Cleveland is just frisky enough to hang with the Outdoor Saints.\nAll right, enough about real football for a few paragraphs. Lets talk about \n. Its time.\nI mentioned last week that \n included three of the biggest logic mistakes in sports-movie history. Many of you asked what they were. Before I rattle them off, I want to say the following things: Itas a splendid airplane/hotel/PPV movie (keeps your interest the whole time); itas well directed (Ivan Reitman uses the split screen in a genuinely inventive way); it features a throwback Costner performance (heas as likable as ever); and every Goodell cameo was already funny, but now you get to watch those scenes while making peanut gallery jokes like, aHold on one second, I just have to tell my secretary to throw an elevator video tape in the trash, Iall be right back.a\nAlso -- you get to watch Denis Leary pretend to be an NFL head coach (heas actually good), you get to watch Jennifer Garner pretend to be a salary cap expert (sheas not as good), and you get to make fun of a ludicrous running subplot in which Costner and Garner are trying to hide their office romance by repeatedly hiding in closets to talk (because that always works). And you get to see Browns owner Frank Langella somehow get himself from the draft in downtown Manhattan to the Browns offices in Cleveland in less than 40 minutes. One disclaimer: You do NOT get to see Mike Lombardi get stabbed in the back; that was real life.\nOK, here were the three indefensible logic mistakes. Just skip to the next pick if you havenat seen \n yet.\n On the morning of the draft, Seattle calls Costner and offers no. 1 overall (landing him the draftas fictional Franchise QB) for Costneras next three no. 1 picks. Costner immediately accepts without (a) checking with his owner, (b) checking with his staff, and (c) doing any background intel on a Franchise QB that he never expected to pick. I mean ... you canat even make a fantasy football trade with a drunk buddy at 2 a.m. in 30 seconds anymore. Seriously, thatas how the movie starts!?\n Costner becomes worried about the Franchise QB, does some background intel, investigates some possibly bogus story that nobody showed up at the QBas birthday party, then calls him at the draft and asks him if winning is important to him. When he doesnat like the answer, Costner decides NOT to take the QB -- only he doesnat tell his owner or his staff, he doesnat try to trade down,A and instead takes a linebacker who was expected to fall into the teens first overall. So basically, he traded three no. 1 picks to move up six spots to take someone who would have been there at no. 7.\nIN ALL CAPS: THIS IS THE DUMBEST SPORTS MOVIE IN A LONG TIME. THIS MOVIE MAKES YOU DUMBER AS YOU WATCH IT. YOU ACTUALLY LOSE BRAIN CELLS.\n Now everyoneas mad at Costner -- his owner, his coaches, his staff, everyone. Somehow, the Franchise QB starts miraculously dropping after Cleveland passes on him. \n (Imagine Indy passing on Andrew Luck at no. 1, then Luck inexplicably dropping out of the top five, and it gives you a sense of how idiotic this script idea was.) With the Jags on the clock at no. 6, Costner decides to trade for their pick ... he ends up getting it for his next three second-rounders in about 40 seconds, thanks to Jacksonvilleas young GM grabbing the offer without shopping it around or letting anyone else know the pick had become available. Because that would happen.\n(Important: Even though thatas an absolutely moronic trade that would NEVER happen in real life, especially with a Franchise QB on the board, I decided not to include it as an Indefensible Logic Mistake because of Jacksonvilleas track record over the past few years. Can we definitively say that the Jags wouldnat do something that dumb? No.)\nAnyway, Costner owns no. 6, and Seattleas GM (picking no. 7) is taking major heat from Seahawks fans for passing up the Franchise QB even though (a) five other teams just passed on him, and (b) everyone watching this knows they already have Russell Wilson and is wondering why the \n writers didnat pick a different team. Costner calls him and offers no. 6 for Seattleas three no. 1 picks.\naI want my picks back!a\nDoes Seattleas GM immediately cave? Of course! He agrees after his boss tells him (Iam paraphrasing), aWe still get the QB we wanted, only now weare saving $7 million on the cap.a Totally! That would makeA perfect sense if I had a head injury. But wait! Costner just welched on the trade -- now heas asking for three first-rounders AND their punt returner. Does Seattle say yes? OF COURSE! Woo-hoo! Hugs galore in the war room! Costner did it! He grabs the hometown running back hero with Seattleas pick, then asks Leary (who quit earlier), aCan you coach this team?a\nSorry, I have to swear here ... THIS MOVIE WAS SO F-a-a-aING DUMB. GOD! HOW DOES THIS SCRIPT GO THROUGH A START-TO-FINISH REVISION PROCESS AND GET FILMED WITHOUT ANYONE ASKING, aHEY, SHOULD WE SHOW THIS TO SOMEONE WHO FOLLOWS FOOTBALL JUST TO MAKE SURE THESE TRADES ARENaT TOO RIDICULOUS???a What a waste of a throwback Costner performance. I am still upset. Although I guess you canat expect too much out of a movie that has Diddy playing a high-powered sports agent,A and also, Diddy playing ANYONE.A Letas move on before I trade this Friday picks column to Bill Barnwell for two weekly blog posts and a useful advanced-metric stat to be named later.\n\nWhen in doubt, go against the NFC East. Well, unless ...\n\nLast week, Tyler from Philly alerted me, \"CBSSports has eight aexpertsa picking every game against the spread. Whenever all eight experts were on the same side of a game in 2013, they went 0-9 in that game. For this Week 1, all eight have the Bears -7.5 over the Bills. \n!a Of course, I ignored Tyleras email and took Chicago because I am a stupid, stupid person. Well, I couldnat resist checking out their Week 2 picks, and wouldnat you know? \n. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\nYou know the reasons: The Vikes looked great last week ... you gotta love a good home dog getting points ... the Pats are 2-6 in their last eight road games ... the Pats might not be able to block ... Brady was 10-for-27 in the second half against Miami for 62 yards ... the Pats donat have a single skill position guy who truly scares you, and by the way, they traded the Cordarrelle Patterson pick to Minnesota and thereas no way he isnat scoring an 80-yard TD in this game ... New Englandas allegedly improved secondary didnat look that improved last week ... Vince Wilfork looks like luggage ... and the Pats have a habit of playing like shit in back-to-back games in the Belichick-Brady era.\n(Oh, wait, itas the opposite! Lemme change this pick.)\n\nWeave been here before. Thatas all I am saying. And since thatas the most homerific moment of the column, allow me to temper it with a mean email about Tom Brady from Eric in New York City.\nAnd Iam supposed to lay points on the road with Ryan Fitzpatrick because ... why?\n\nAmerica, Iad like to apologize for missing Carolinaas aNobody Believes In Us!a potential last Sunday. Any doubt that itas the NFLas most important X factor was erased when it single-handedly transformed Derek Anderson into a semi-competent QB.\n The reality is this: Seattle is better than everyone, the Raiders-Rams-Cowboys are worse than everyone, and the other 27 teams could beat anyone else on any given week. Make your picks accordingly.\nTwo enjoyableA factors in play withA that Panthers pick: First, you gotta love going against Matt Stafford (and the entire Lions fan base in general) in a classic aFeeling A Little Too Good After A Big Home Win Against A Bad Teama game. Second, itas an insult to Luke Kuechly and Carolinaas terrific defense that they arenat even favored by three at home. Reader Tyrone Kirk says it best: aWe keep hearing how dominant J.J. Watt was in Week 1. Do you realize the reigning DPOY had nine tackles, two for a loss, a sack, a pass defense that caused an int, and forced the fumble that sealed the win over Tampa? Does Kuechly have to get ALL of the Carolina tackles to be held in the same conversation of dominance as Watt?a\nMeanwhile, you might remember me picking Tampa to become the NFC Southas second playoff team (over Carolina). If they donat annihilate that putrid Rams team on Sunday, Iam out on Tampa. Gambling 101 -- settle on the teams you like and ride them in September, but if youare wrong, bail as quickly as possible. And I might have been wrong on Tampa. Their front seven wasnat as dominant as I thought; Lovie Smithas missionary position offense couldnat have been less effective (as I secretly feared); and Josh McCown looked like a 35-year-old journeyman QB who roped someone into a big contract because he had five good games throwing to Marshall and Jeffery (as I secretly feared). Tampa is on gambling probation for me. One more week.\n\nOne variable that I will keep forcing myself to remember this season: aAlways grab the Good Team That Desperately Needs A Win over The Not-As-Good Team That Just Had A Win, no matter what the spread is.a Letas rip through a few quick emails.\nBS: Couldnat we combine both? What if Cowboys fans showed up for home games dressed in white like the Guilty Remnant, chain-smoking cigarettes and watching all four quarters in silence? Couldnat they at least try this for the Thanksgiving game if theyare 0-11?\nBS: Thanks for not calling it the Curse of Gisele. Seriously. I appreciate it. You could easily name the curseA after Janet Jones (may have broken up Gretzkyas Oilers dynasty by brainwashing him to move to L.A.), Tatum OaNeal (submarined John McEnroes tennis prime) and Common (thats right, I switched genders on you -- check out Serena Williamss free fallA from 2008 to 2010!). But for me, it makes the most sense to name it after Memo Paris -- Kim Basingeras black widow character in \n who briefly derailed Roy Hobbsas career. She was gorgeous, she dressed in black, his numbers dipped immediately, she nearly shot him after they broke up, she caused his insides to nearly melt ... I mean, what else do you need? I vote for the Curse of Memo.\nBS: I donat appreciate that, Doc.\nBS: Seriously, scale it back a notch, Doc.\nBS: Hey, Doc? Youare revving my RPMs right now. Enough.\nSG: STOP IT! NOT FUNNY! I WILL QUIT THE WEEK 2 PICKS COLUMN IF YOU KEEP THIS UP!\n(Back to the picks ... )\n\nTwo inflated lines that disrespect two massive underdogs in Full-Fledged Kitchen Sink mode. I still like the 2014 Chargers to make the playoffs; I donat like the 2014 Chiefs even a little. But the Kitchen Sink WILL be involved in these games. Three more reader emails ...\nBS: I donat know if agloriousa is a strong enough word. Can you think of a better finish for Goodellas last NFL season than James Dolan playing halftime of the Super Bowl? Please, Lord, let this happen.\nBS: Great idea. But wouldnat the obvious candidate be Andy Dalton? What if Andy shaved his red hair, grew a goatee and dyed it black, insisted that everyone call him by his last name, started snapping at reporters and dating partying celebs like Rihanna, and ended up leading MediaTakeOut every other week with headlines like aDALTON FOUND HIMSELF A NEW SIDE PIECE ... AND YOUaRE NOT GONNA BELIEVE WHO IT IS!a Think about it, Andy. You donat have to give us an answer right now. Just think about it.\nBS: Yup, these are my readers. Back to the picks.\n\nYour textbook Week 2 overreaction line: In Week 1, the Niners looked better than they are (mainly because Dallas sucks and Romo was abysmal), and the Bears looked worse than they are (mainly because Buffalo might be sneaky-good). As Rob in West Haven writes, aAny chance that Week 1 was one of Jay Cutlers Moron Games? Heas good for two per year.a Exactly. Cutler usually doesnat have back-to-back Moron Games. Thatas why I am making the Bears my Week 2 Upset Special: Bears 34, Niners 30.\nMeanwhile, heres the meanest email of Week 2, courtesy of Vineeth in San Francisco: \"Hey, how come the staff pictures for Grantland look like a compilation of mugshots from the 49er defense?\" Not. Friendly. Words hurt.\n\nI donat see Andrew the Giant going 0-2. Sorry. Enjoy the weekend."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/week-3-picks-adrian-peterson-roger-goodell/", "blog_text": "Anytime I unleash a special-edition mailbag, you know something bonkers happened on the level of Bernard Karmell Pollard \n, Tiger Woods \n, Manti Teo \n, or the NFLs overmatched replacement officials reverse-peaking during \n. A special-edition mailbag is really saying three things:\n WTF???\n\n\n My readers sent along so many good emails that we HAD to do a mailbag.\n\n\n Seriously ... WTF???????\nSo you couldnt have been surprised when last weeks Rice/TMZ/Ravens mega-debacle earned its own \n. The latest NFL Debacle Of The Week didnt quite earn its own Peterson-Might-Have-To-Go Bag, but at the very least it earned a half-mailbag before we tackle Week 3 picks. As always, these are actual emails from actual readers.\nBS: I once believed Bills fans and Browns fans were the MJ and Russell of this category -- two unassailable resumes for \"Best Ever\" that couldnt be leapfrogged unless something truly astounding happened. Well, think about how these past few months have played out.\n* The city of Buffalo saved its franchise, found a local owner, started out 2-0, cheered on Jim Kelly as he improbably fended off cancer, just savored one of the most emotional home wins in recent NFL history (Week 2, Miami), and even inspired a possible change to the \"Dont bet against God, puppies or gambling theories hatched in Pakistan\" rule (hold that thought).\n* The city of Cleveland dented its perpetual malaise by bringing LeBron back, drafting Johnny Football, getting fictionally rejuvenated in the ridiculous \n, shocking the Saints at home in Week 2, and starring in 20,000 LeBron-inspired \"Im Coming Home\" montages on YouTube. You wouldnt say Browns fans are flying high, but they arent moping around and questioning why God hates them so much, either.\n* The state of Minnesota just limped through another four-sport belly flop; saw Donald Sterling sell the Clippers and inadvertently give the \"Least Competent Current NBA Owner\" championship belt to Glen Taylor (belated congrats, Glen); saw Vikings owners Zygi and Mark Wilf grab the \"Sketchiest NFL Owners\" championship belt after they had to pay an \n for real estate fraud (congrats, fellas); lost Kevin Love AND Jared Allen; lost their greatest superstar since Kevin Garnett indefinitely because of a child-abuse scandal; and realized retroactively that they committed more than $400 million of public funds to a football stadium for a franchise run by a crook and starring someone who thrashes the living crap out of defenseless 4-year-old kids with a branch. Oh, and theyre 0-4 in the Super Bowl with no chance of that flipping anytime soon.\n(Thinking.)\nFine, Im not ready to leapfrog ANYONE past the Browns (no Super Bowls, had their team stolen) or Bills (four straight Super Bowl losses, no sign of any real hope during the 21st century). But at the very least, cant we say the Vikings have turned it into a three-way battle? And that theyve figured out a way to break new ground here in one of the most depressing ways possible? Check out this next email.\nBS: I can relate to some of this. Eight months after the 18-1/Helmet Catch/Spygate/Tom Brady-Pat OBrien Pregame SB Handshake/Ruined-My-Dads-60th-Birthday/Every-Giants-Fan-Smugly-Smiles-At-Me-For-The-Rest-Of-My-Life season, I lost Tom Brady from my real team and my fantasy team eight and a half minutes into 2008s suddenly aborted Were Getting Revenge Liam Neeson-Style On Everyone And Their Brother season. My entire football season ended before 2 p.m. ET in Week 1. I continue to feel guilty about (a) not appreciating the three Super Bowl seasons more, (b) drafting Brady in fantasy that year, and (c) not seeing the whole thing coming because everything from 2001 to 2007 had turned Patriots fans into the football version of Yankees fans and we never wanted to believe it happened (but it did).\nSo that hurt. All of it. You know injuries happen, you reconcile them, you blame the karma gods, you blame the person who caused it (whether its fair or not), you bank on a quick rehab and do whatever else you need to do. But losing your signature player (and one of the leagues most entertaining players in general) because he intentionally injured his own son? How do you bounce back from that? How do you root for him again?\nImportant: I dont believe Peterson should lose his football career. Eventually, the man will publicly exhibit the proper level of contrition (were not even close yet) and turn this situation into a positive (pretty easily, he could become one of our most visible advocates against child abuse, as soon as he successfully deals with whatever baggage hes carrying). And theres clearly a cultural component to what happened here, as Charles Barkley clumsily tried to argue on CBS last Sunday.\nAt the same time, I am raising two kids -- my daughter (9) and my son (6) -- both of whom were 4 once. If you havent raised a child yet, please understand the following things:\n Kids can be annoying as hell.\n Kids can be frustrating as hell.\n Little boys are dumber than little girls.\n Four-year-old boys might be lovable as hell, but theyre also operating within the perfect storm of \"Why did you do that?,\" \"What are you thinking?,\" and \"You can never do that again!!!!!\" Four-year-old boys will absolutely try to jump down a flight of stairs, dive into the shallow end of the pool, punch you in the balls, inadvertently run across the street when youre not looking ... they are just complete dumb-asses at all times. I have multiple friends who had or have little boys; all of them, at some point, said to themselves, \"Wait, is there something wrong with my son?\" And I was right there with them.\nSometimes, you have to discipline them so they know right from wrong -- mainly so they dont hurt themselves or someone else, because, again, little boys are lovable dumb-asses. And thats something every parent handles differently. You can yell, you can scream, you can take away their favorite toy/show/activity, you can even play the spanking card (some do, some dont). You do whatever it takes to get from Point A to Point B. Within reason.\nBut HURTING your own kid?\nOr leaving still-bleeding-after-six-hours welts all over the lower half of his body?\nI mean ...\nWhen youre a parent, you constantly identify with other parents in every situation. You recognize the same defeated looks, you recognize the same look of panic when a parent cant control a kid in public, you recognize the same look of utter horror on an airplane when a shrieking kid is gaining steam and there are still three hours to go. And on the flip side, when some parental experience is spiraling out of control, you might see a veteran parent glancing your way with one of those \"Hang in there, it gets better\" looks. There are dozens and dozens of ways you bond with other parents, day in and day out, and thats just how it goes. Its almost like an unspoken language that you cant speak in unless youve been there.\nFor me, the problem with what Peterson did, and everything it represents, is that I fundamentally cant understand why someone would injure their own kid. My children have injured themselves unintentionally a handful of times. When your child is in pain, its just about the craziest experience you will ever have as a human being. Its like your head comes off your body. When my son was 2, my daughter accidentally slammed a shower door on his index finger and nearly chopped it off. That thing was \n And if youve ever heard your own child scream in pain and terror, you never forget the sound. You just dont.\nWe threw some clothes on him -- blood dripping everywhere -- and he was crying so hard that his eyes were practically rolling back in his head. If that wasnt bad enough, my daughter was sobbing and blaming herself for what happened. And everyone was covered in blood. We packed into the car and pulled off a 15-minute drive in about eight minutes. I was weaving between lanes and passing people on the wrong side of the road like a NASCAR driver. It was insane. I wanted to make sure he didnt lose his finger, but also the crying was just about the worst noise I had ever heard. Four years later, I can still hear it.\nAnd yeah, we saved the finger, and theres barely even a scar because little kids have healing powers that transcend just about anything. Adrian Petersons kid probably wont have scars, either. That Peterson can live with himself for causing that sound, with no apparent remorse, disturbs the shit out of me. I cant look at him the same way.\nBut thats just me. So we remain in that excruciating vortex where sports (the escape from real life) intersects with real life -- yet again -- and were just sitting here looking at each other and waiting for the perfect answer, which is never coming. Eventually, someone will convince Peterson that he needs therapy, and that he needs to become an advocate against child abuse. Peterson will follow that persons instructions for one of two reasons: He wants to save his football career or he understands that he failed as a parent and a human being (and needs to fix it going forward). One or both of those reasons will be genuine. Lets hope for both.\n(In other words, to be continued.)\nBS: What Diane said.\nBS: Come on, Goodell only went into hiding until todays too-little-too-late press conference for eight days! Thats not hiding, thats ... oh wait, thats totally hiding. But you made a great point. If 1990s Stern were running the NFL right now, hed be growing a scruffy beard, giving two sarcastically abrasive interviews per day, vowing to clean up the league and demanding a 10-minute exclusive interview before every Thursday-night game on CBS. We would make jokes about him, but wed begrudgingly respect him too. His heart would be in the right place.\nMeanwhile, Roger Goodell is handling this entire month like an overwhelmed bartender who falls 10 drink orders behind, cant handle the rush, and finally decides to hide in a backroom until customers start leaving. And you know what? I think the owners love it. As long as people are discussing Goodells many inadequacies, nobody is talking about the 32 owners who run the league and order him around. Baltimores owner clearly lobbied Goodell last summer to \n on Ray Rice because \n and \n. Minnesotas owners clearly botched their Peterson decision, then had to do a 180 once sponsors started ditching them. But its much easier to blame Goodell than the owners, even though he works for them and obviously cant think for himself. What a mess. Say what you want about David Stern -- during his prime, he always stood up for himself, he always remained accountable, and he never would have allowed himself to become the sacrificial patsy to a bunch of bumbling owners. (That only happened later, and well after his prime.)\nBS: I dont see it. Were at least two more debacles away. Youll know that Goodell is about to get fired when Peter King finally turns on him. Peter King is like Abe Vigoda in the last hour of \n -- as soon as he breaks, youll know shit is about to go down.\n\n\nBS: Amazing. All roads lead back to \n.\nBS: All fair points. Ill give that nickname a test spin during the next email answer and see how it goes.\nBS: If and when the \n guys write a Revenue Roger book, I demand they call it \n That also sounds like a great title for a potential 2017 documentary that ESPN will abruptly cancel. Im excited on all fronts.\n(PS: I like Revenue Roger! Fun test spin! Im in!)\nBS: And its not just the NFL. For two years now, I have become convinced that certain NBA teams leak trade possibilities just to see how their fans react. Example A: The Warriors wavering on putting Klay Thompson in a potential Kevin Love deal. Example B: Sacramento tossing around the possibility of trading for Josh Smith. Example C: Every single Knicks decision. Fan crowdsourcing is a thing -- theres no question. I dont think that happened with Rice, but its almost definitely what happened with the Vikings and Peterson. You can always make a light punishment tougher; you cant go the other way. I think the Vikings started out light while secretly hoping nobody would flip out (so they didnt lose Peterson for too long), then corrected it accordingly after everyone flipped out. Brilliant! Except for the part where everyone now thinks they are bumbling morons with no moral compass and no compassion for children.\nBS: The world absolutely needs this to happen. \nBS: Come on, this isnt the 1994 Best Picture race for the Oscars; we wont be arguing about it 20 years from now. Donald Sterling is our 2014 Anti-Sportsman of the Year. The race ended last spring. Its over. He just put up stats on the level of 2001 Barry Bonds, even if weve been blessed (or unblessed) with an impressive array of second-place candidates. You know what my favorite part of that email was? James is right -- history says the annual college football scandal is still coming! Its been an all-you-can-eat buffet of Anti-Sportsman moments for nearly nine months, and they havent even served the prime rib yet.\nBS: Forgetting to include Isiah on Lousy Commissioner Mount Rushmore was like forgetting to include Jay Z on Mount Rapmore. I have no defense. I need to retire soon.\nBS: You just mentioned the best reason to defend Revenue Roger -- we need him to stick around until next spring just for the boos. Thats going to be the funniest four hours of 2015. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Should he just turn himself into a wrestling heel? What if Goodell kept walking onto the stage before every pick with Vince McMahons \"No Chance in Hell\" entrance music blaring? Cant somebody doctor a YouTube clip from last years draft so that we can know what it sounds like? I dont ask for much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBS: Hold on ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBS: I received those emails less than a week apart. Amazing.\n\n\nBS: Bless you, Matthew from Middlebury. Bless you. A couple of thoughts ...\n I cant believe we had the balls to throw the ball from our own 17 with 81 seconds left and no timeouts and a first-year starting QB.\n I cant believe the officials said J.R. Redmond got out of bounds.\n I cant believe the Rams left Troy Brown that wide open.\n I cant believe how quickly Madden flip-flopped during the drive.\n I cant believe the Patriots actually won that game after the defensive TD got called back, which had all the makings of The Next Devastating Post-Buckner Boston Sports Moment, only it got washed away and now I never think about it.\n \n. JESUS. I was there. In the same end zone where the winning kick landed. Amazing. Incredible. I am not ashamed to admit that it was one of the 10 best moments of my life.\n I cant believe a measly seven-minute clip washed away these past two weeks and got me fired up for football again. Im so easy. On to the Week 3 picks ...\n(Home teams in caps)\n\nI nailed this Thursday pick \n. All Thursday picks will be made on \n this season (including Thanksgiving). If that doesnt change my Thursday luck, then were moving to Pinterest next year. I am going to keep changing social-media platforms until I turn this Thursday curse around. But you know whats not turning around? The 2014 Bucs season! My God! I havent been that wrong about something since I predicted Adam Brody was going to be the next Tom Hanks. Uh-oh, the readers want in.\nBS: Its dead equal. I feel equal amounts of shame, confusion, regret and hypothetical self-hatred.\nBS: Sorry, I cant count out Minnesotas Ewing Theory potential yet (how many playoff games did they win with Peterson?), especially in that division and especially when Teddy Bridgewater is lurking. But I actually counted out the Bucs last Sunday after they got beaten by a backup QB for the second straight week. They stink. At least I realized it after Week 2 and not Week 12. As for a new-and-improved NFC sleeper ... hold that thought. Youre not gonna believe it, but I have a convoluted opinion on this.\nBS: Come on, Houston is 2014s Good Bad Team. They might win 12 games and still end up being six-point dogs at home in Round 1. Atlanta is 2014s Much More Fun As a Fantasy Team Than A Real Team team. Thats their destiny.\nBS: Against the Pats last week, Cassel threw eight passes that went 10 or more yards; all eight were incomplete and three were picked off. The TAINTTFCMZTMTBTSQB is going to be epic. We should be able to wager on which Saint gets it. (I want 20 bucks on Kenny Vaccaro.) So why grab the points? Because its the Year of the Dog, because Minnesota was clearly affected by the Peterson saga last week, because theres no way Cassel can suck that much two weeks in a row, and because theres enough of a chance that New Orleans might be 2014s Unexpected Year From Hell team that a double-digit spread frightens me (even in the Superdome).\nBS: If you ever want to fluster a Cowboys fan, ask them if theyd trade DeMarco Murray for Adrian Peterson right now. Wouldnt that be the jerryjonesiest move of all time? And shouldnt jerryjonesiest be a word? As in, \"Did I tell you about the time I almost sold my condo under market, then some crazy guy made me the jerryjonesiest offer ever?\" Or, \"I told my wife Id be home at 10:30, but then we went to another bar and it turned into the jerryjonesiest of nights ... and now Im sleeping in the garage.\"\n\nImportant: I love the Chargers and still think theyre going 11-5. Just know that something special is brewing in Buffalo. I loved \n about Sundays Miami win: \"We played for them, and we played with them. It was just an amazing, amazing day. It was beyond what I expected. The fans were so amazing today. I felt the energy the whole day today. It never let up. It was unbelievable. I never in a million years dreamed it would be that special.\" Lets run this back! YOU CAN DO IT!\nBS: I want to see them beat the Chargers first. My one red flag with Buffalo: EJ Manuel isnt accurate. Its a problem. They can cheat it, they can work around it, they can survive it ... but at some point, theyre going to be trailing by four against a good team and hes gonna have to make some throws. His balls sail all over the place. As any Sammy Watkins fantasy owner can tell you.\n\nTwo unequivocal \"I just think these teams might be really good\" picks. I loved this next email ...\nBS: You mean, if youre slammered?\n\nIts the I Dont Trust Either Of These Teams Bowl. I dont know who will win this game, but bad clock management will definitely be involved. Our Shaky Watch for Week 3: Every EJ Manuel pass, the Colin Kaepernick era, the Mike McCarthy era, the Marques Colston fantasy era, Tampas play calling, Tampas everything, Pitts lines, the Titans/Raiders run defense, Detroit taking Eric Ebron over Aaron Donald and Kyle Fuller (yikes), the Marques Colston fantasy era, Jacksonvilles O-line, the NFLs 10-second runoff injury rule, the Eddie Lacy Fantasy Support Group, the KC/TB/Det/Cincy kickers, the Jets secondary, New Orleanss second CB, the Drew Brees Superstar QB Era, Cincy without A.J. Green, any \"First Coach Fired\" wager thats not Dennis Allen.\n\n\n\nThe Colts cant run the ball, they cant rush the passer, and they have a dangerous multiseason habit of giving up gobs of unanswered points in short periods of time. And the Patriots love mailing in home games when theyre favored by too many points against an atrocious opponent. As reader Ryan B. in Maryland points out, \"Belichicks forte is figuring out what your team does well and game planning to take it away. This Raiders team does NOTHING well. We have your Pats right where we want them!\" One of these teams isnt covering. I wish I knew which one.\nIn other news, the Pats are 1-0 since I started running mean Tom Brady emails. So for karmas sake, Im gonna keep that gimmick going.\nBS: Wait a second, wait a second. Did you just ask \"Can you see any other athlete posing for this picture?\" when Alex Rodriguez is still alive? How dare you. HOW. DARE. YOU.\n\nDo you realize that Ryan Fitzpatricks Texans might be 8-0 heading into a Week 9 showdown with Nick Foles and the 7-0 Eagles? Look at their respective schedules; its not insane. You know what WAS insane? Eli saying the 2014 Giants are \n. They are equally awful, actually. Speaking of Eli ...\nBS: Are you crazy? Eli never misses games! Hed make an alliance with J-Law in the first hour and last until the bitter end. Were never getting rid of Eli. The first to go, without question, would be Robert Griffin III. Here, look.\nBS: Its like one of my favorite Mike Lombardi sayings: \"Were only one injury away from having a good team.\"\nBS: Its a fantastic point. Imagine Chuck Paganos demeanor if Andrew Luck had just gotten knocked out indefinitely ... and then, think about how Jay Gruden and every D.C. fan is handling this RG3 thing. Are you ready for Kirk Cousins to be the QB of 2014s NFC sleeper? Its in play. My Week 3 Upset Special: Washington 36, Philly 31.\n\nAs the worlds biggest proponent of the \"Succeeeding at QB is 75 percent personality/charisma/coolness/intelligence/competitiveness/leadership and 25 percent talent\" theory, I feel obligated to pimp the Austin Davis era. First, \n in this postgame piece from Sundays Tampa Bay win. Second, I lost money on Sunday because of that dude -- you dont truly know someone until youre betting against them, and for whatever reason, I was scared of Austin Davis on that final drive. I really was. I dont know what to tell you. The dude was making throws. And third and most important ... this.\n(Translation: Were laying less than a field goal to that crappy Cowboys team? FUCK YEAH! FUCK YEAH!)\n\nBut hey ... how bout those Royals! Heres an email from Florida ...\n\n\n\n\nBS: Heyyyyyyyyyyyy! Whoa!!!!! Thats our president! YOU DO NOT COMPARE OUR PRESIDENT TO TONY ROMO! THAT WAS UNCALLED FOR!!!! YOU APOLOGIZE RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThursday night, September 11, 2014 ... the night Steelers fans realized that their team stunk.\n\nSunday night, September 14, 2014 ... the night Niners fans officially started worrying about Colin Kaepernick. Hes just good enough to take your breath away and just sloppy enough to take your breath away -- in other words, hes the rich mans Geno Smith. Andre from El Cajon writes in, \"Kaepernick just had one of the worst performances for an elite QB on primetime in a while. If throwing 3 INTs and losing a fumble seems so rare, will we ever see another Full Delhomme? You created that term after Jake had 5 INTs and a lost fumble in a home playoff loss -- is that ever happening again?\"\nThe short answer: Absolutely. Eli threw five picks against Seattle just last year. Well see another Full Delhomme sooner than you think. But anytime your star QB gets successfully compared to Geno Smith AND Jake Delhomme, youre probably in trouble. I think the Niners might be in trouble. Our Unexpected Year From Hell candidates have been narrowed down to New Orleans, Indianapolis and San Francisco. (Im counting out Kansas City because that was an Expected Year From Hell.) One of those three teams is going 6-10 or 5-11.\nOn our most positive note, heres our Sneaky-Good Watch for Week 3: Philip Riverss Hall of Fame chances, the Chandler Jones era, Cris Carter coming at Ray Lewis, Austin Daviss Poor Mans Kurt Warner potential, Dallass running game, 2014 first-round D-backs, all Mike Sando columns, Bobby Rainey, Lombardis Brian Hoyer call from three years ago, anyone who kept their Darren Sproles and Devin Hester stock, LeVeon Bell, Kelvin Benjamin, ANDY DALTON!, Sammy Watkins, Sammy Watkins a second time, Buffalos everything except for QB, Carolinas defense, all Austin Davis \"Fuck Yeah!\" GIFs.\n\nWeve seen two wilting-in-the-heat September losses so far: New England in Miami, and Seattle in San Diego. Dont overreact to wilting-in-the-heat losses, dont go against Seattle at home, and dont think Denver did enough during the offseason to change everything that happened in the Super Bowl. Because they didnt. By the way, this email intrigued me.\nBS: Come on, Im the king of conspiracies -- like you werent getting me to bite on that one? Smart move by San Diego for two reasons: (1) Its definitely firing up Seattle and Sherman this week, and (2) couldnt you see Seattle and San Diego meeting in the Super Bowl five months from now, but not before we spend an hour at media day with reporters asking Richard Sherman if hes still mad about what the Chargers said about him? Savvy all the way around.\n\n\nBS: How the hell am I supposed to remember that? Cant one of them just switch their number to 13? How many confusing 80/88 moments are we supposed to have? These are two of the 10 best fantasy receivers in football -- they have the same name, theyre built the same and their numbers look the same. Its ridiculous. I cant take it anymore. Im adding this to the list of Roger Goodell failures -- no competent commissioner would allow this!\n\nBooooooooooooooooooo! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n(I cant wait.)\n "}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-annual-nba-league-pass-rankings-part-1/", "blog_text": "The Grantland Basketball Hour\n kicked off with Simmons writing, \"If I watch more than 75 total minutes of the Suns this season, Im gonna feel like I failed.\"\nSo clearly, you came to the right place for intelligent analysis and an all-encompassing feel for the league. Our mission remains the same: Figure out which 2014-15 NBA teams have the best chance to steal our attention, night after night, as were watching five games at once. Both Simmons and Lowe awarded all 30 teams between 0 and 10 points in each of the following five categories.\n\nInterpreted as \"relevance to the playoff picture,\" \"relevance to NBA junkies on the Internet,\" and \"general day-to-day relevance.\" In other words, you went 0-for-3, Philly.

If youre coaching so creatively that you coax Zach into one of those 4,500-word columns with 15 embedded YouTube clips, youll score highly here.\n\nCovers the quality of announcing teams (a.k.a. The Sean Elliott Mute Button Factor) and sideline reporters (we love you, \n!), as well as uniform colors, crowd behavior, any wide shot of empty seats on TV (sorry, Miami), \n, the mascots, and for a second time, the mascots. You know, all the stuff Zach obsesses over.\n\nIf you employ the likes of LeBron, Durant or Curry on your team? Youre looking great for this category. If you revolve your team around Boogie Cousins? Youre looking great with one of us and shockingly decent with the other one. But if your only exciting player is missing the entire 2014-15 season with a broken leg? You might be looking at a Robert Parish -- a.k.a. the double zero.\n\nThis intentionally vague category covers moments like \"Enes Kanter just took his 10th 3 of the night,\" \"Byron Scott is defending Phoenixs 3-guard offense with Jeremy Lin, Nick Young and Steve Nash right now,\" \"Boris Diaw is feeling it,\" any text or tweet that simply reads \"Dante Exum!!!!,\" \"Marcus Smart just dove for a loose ball and inadvertently took out the scorers table while down 25 with 90 seconds to play,\" \"Giannis is starting at point guard,\" \"Dion Waiters is feeling it,\" \"Dirk just made his seventh straight one-legged fall-away,\" \"Blake Griffin just tried to dunk over four Warriors at the same time,\" \"Zach LaVines dunk from three minutes ago has already generated 220 comments on NBA Reddit,\" \"Jamal Crawford is feeling it,\" \"Kenneth Faried is playing tonight like terrorists told him he had to grab 30 rebounds or they were burning down his house,\" all \"STEPHEN CURRY HEAT CHECK!\" texts, \"Stan Van Gundy called a 20 just to stare down Josh Smith for 20 seconds,\" and \"Ricky Rubio has apparently decided that hes only throwing alley-oop passes in tonights game.\" You know, the stuff that makes the NBAs regular season resonate with the true junkies every night.\nWe each scored all 30 teams on our own, then combined those scores into a bigger score that youll read below.

And it was my fault.\n You mean because the Sixers gutted their team, spent the lowest percentage of available salary cap money in recent NBA history, used two top-12 lottery picks on players who wont be playing for them this season and enraged the NBA to the point that it might change the lottery rules DURING THE SEASON ... and we didnt initially have them ranked 30 out of 30?\n At least we fixed it, even if we had to go back and reengineer the scores! The Sixers are going to be unwatchable. Learning Nerlens Noels game will be fun, and theres still a chance Joel Embiid gets some late-season playing time. Theyll run and jack 3s, but, holy hell, they are going to be awful.\n Instead of trotting out their intentionally crappy team, maybe they should bring back former Sixers greats like Iverson, Dawkins, Julius and Moses and just play the season that way. Just throw out an old-timers team. Oh, wait, theyre already kind of doing that with Jason Richardson.\n Philly does get the edge over Utah in all the silly sideshow categories: The Sixers League Pass experience is much more pleasant, and they scored way higher on my \"zeitgeist\" scale, since theyve tanked their way into the day-to-day NBA conversation. The league is going to change the freaking rules because of them!\n So youre arguing that, if Philly is 4-53 in March, thats going to make you MORE likely to watch them? Theres no way I am watching the 2014-15 Sixers unless theyre playing my Celtics, or unless someone sends me a text saying that LeBron or Durant has 49 through three quarters against them.\n Youre right: Their form of cultural currency doesnt translate into basketball watchability. We ended up in the right place, and were probably even underselling Utah in their new spot.\n This made me sad.\n Its so, so sad. I mean, this offense was borderline unwatchable in high-stakes playoff games -- and that was with Paul George and Lance Stephenson. Guys were straight-up dropping the ball and dribbling it out of bounds. I love defense. Defense can be entertaining. Roy Hibbert clashes at the rim are entertaining. George going toe-to-toe with LeBron or Durant was entertaining. But offense drives the real fun, and Indy could be working in molasses.\n They have to trade David West within the next three months, right? In the Bill and Jalen Preview for the Pacers (coming Wednesday!), Jalen smartly pushes for a West-to-Charlotte trade for former Hoosier Noah Vonleh or former Hoosier Cody Zeller. The Pacers should bottom out for a year and get a meaningful asset for West ... right?\n Hmm ... West has a $12.6 million option for the 2015-16 season, and its the rare option that presents an interesting choice for the player. As a 34-year-old on a semi-expiring deal, West just doesnt have a lot of trade value. I dont see the Hornets giving up a potential good young big for him, but they are the right sort of team for a trade like this -- a longtime sad sack with some irrational exuberance and/or desperation to accelerate their rise.\n We disagree -- its difficult enough to find a playoff-proven veteran/locker room leader that Wests value might be higher than you think. I would flip Zeller for him in 2.2 seconds. Imagine Charlotte becoming a genuine contender. And even better, imagine West and Lance improbably reuniting. If it happens, I hope someone takes a cell phone video of West rejoicing upon hearing that he got traded to a contender ... and then realizing that he has to play with Lance again.\n West doesnt make Charlotte a legitimate contender. But Zeller-Gerald Henderson is a workable trade package in terms of salary, and I could see Henderson becoming disgruntled as he loses minutes. I just dont think West has much trade value as a rotation wing on another semi-expiring deal.\n Come on ... Big Al, West, Lance, Kemba, Gary Neal, P.J. Hairston, Marvin \"Veteran Leader\" Williams and MKG Who Now Allegedly \n in the messy East? Thats not a contender? They couldnt win two straight playoff series in the East? Careful, youre gonna piss off the 2,500 Charlotte fans.\n Winning two series in the East means beating Chicago or Cleveland, and I dont see your theoretical Hornets roster doing that if both of those teams are healthy.\n To be fair, I factored in the whole \"Derrick Rose hasnt played a healthy month of basketball since a week before my daughters seventh birthday\" subplot into that projection. My daughter is now 9 1/2 .\n Well, that was depressing. Thats ultimately why you have to go for it sometimes, though. No one thought the Pacers would be a game from the Finals in 2013. I just dont think the current Hornets core is as good as you do. As for other places, West would be a good triangle big if the Knicks had anything to trade, and Sacramento is leading the \"irrational exuberance/desperation scale.\" But West is hard to deal, and Indy really values his leadership. They seem to mean it when they say theyre not tanking this one random non-George season.\n If Larry Legend werent involved, Id be writing the words \"Thats the dumbest thing I have ever heard.\" The Pacers need to emulate the 1996-97 Spurs by bottoming out for six months and hoping for their own Duncan-type miracle. By the way, if West gets traded, Indianas already unwatchable 2014-15 offense would revolve around Hibbert and Rodney Stuckey.\n In my \n, I predicted that Stuckey would lead this team in scoring. Think about that.\n Translation: CLICK.\n We gave them 24 points just three weeks ago ... and they gained 10 points in the preseason without playing a real game. Weve never changed a League Pass ranking before. What happened???\n This is more crooked than \n.\n Im wearing a Dick Bavetta jersey as I write these next 19 words: Ive never done a faster 180, in my entire career, than the one I pulled off with Dante Exum. Not only did Jalen and I crush the Exum pick \n, but when you and I worked on the first draft of this piece, heres what I wrote: \"For me, the Exum subplot is 100 times more fascinating than anything Philly is offering. He might be superduperduper raw, and on top of that, three lottery picks taken right after him (Marcus Smart, Julius Randle and my Rookie Of The Year Choice To Be Revealed A Little Bit Later) could be kicking ass right away. That has a chance to be one of this centurys legendarily bad lottery picks.\"\nI nearly gave myself a concussion leaping on the hood of the Exum bandwagon as it started pulling away. Did you see him in the preseason? It looked like Kobe cloned the teenage version of himself and added an Australian accent. Im all in! Easily my fastest flip-flop ever -- and thats saying something.\n Exum is the variance guy in Utahs young core. They have six legitimately interesting young players -- and possibly seven, depending on Rodney Hoods development. But the buzz on Utahs third- and fourth-year guys is sort of fading out. No one is flipping to a Utah game to see a Gordon Hayward jumper streak or some subtle rim protection from Derrick Favors. Theres a reason the Jazz tried to trade for the no. 1 pick: They know all these guys top out as second bananas, and maybe even third bananas. Exum is their guy with the unknown ceiling.\n And we were both shocked by how many 3s Utah jacked up in the preseason. And we havent even mentioned those eight games a year when Hayward improbably goes toe-to-toe against a playoff contender, or the coaching bump from \"Ty Corbin\" to \"anyone else.\" Should we bump their ranking again? You could talk me into the high 40s after one drink.\n We definitely didnt award enough credit for Quin Snyders style bump. It was clear given his work at prior stops: Utah was going to shoot a ton of 3s and try some really interesting stuff on offense. Snyder watches film and sees crazy play-design possibilities that no one else sees. Everyone is jacking 3s for Utah in the preseason -- Favors, Kanter, Jazz Bear, Matt Harpring. We made the right move bumping them to no. 28, and were going to regret not having them higher.\n I like these dudes. I like watching Harris, Oladipo and Nicholson. Vucevic plays hard. Im excited to watch Aaron Gordon run around like he just drank a 48-ounce coffee, and Im excited for his 20 Set-YouTube-Ablaze dunks. Most of all, Im excited for my 2015 Rookie of the Year pick, Elfrid Payton, whos going to haunt the Sixers, Hornets and (especially) Kings while making Gordons career 287.3 percent more fun. Im all in on Elfrid. All in. Bought a few of his Panini rookie cards and everything.\n Wait ... did you actually buy his rookie card? Do people still collect cards?\n Im taking you to the 2015 \n. There are hundreds and hundreds of single white males wearing Hawaiian shirts who want a word with you.\n Orlando is kind of like Utah East, only its unproven young dudes have more of a caffeinated bounce. Oladipo is a League Pass-friendly guy. Both of their rookies should be fun.\n Serious question: Would this team win more games with Jacque Vaughn or Mo Vaughn coaching?\n Youre joking about Vaughn, but thats an interesting subplot here: At some point, your identity has to be about more than hard work and character. There has to be an on-court ideology. This is Year 3 post-Dwight. The fart smell has cleared out of the locker room, and the clock is ticking on the Magic to show us something coherent.\n I ranked them much higher than you, but I still had them in a four-way tie for spots nos. 16-19 -- a ranking that would have been unthinkable for a run-and-gun George Karl Denver team. Two writers dont make a trend, but maybe Denvers appeal has stagnated. Brian Shaw is still feeling his way with a team that sort of bucked under him last season, and this is a weird roster -- seven dudes make between $4.65 million and $11.6 million, and that doesnt even include Kenneth Faried. They have a middle-rung ceiling.\n I feel like Ill spend 10 times more time with them on the Trade Machine than on League Pass.\n Scott Hastings being a top-five overall League Pass homer and constantly railing on referees -- that did not help my ranking.\n I bumped them two points just because marijuana is legal in Colorado -- on a night with a low number of games, at least we can watch Denvers home games and guess which opponents may have wake-and-baked that morning.\n Boogie!!!!!! BOOGIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n He has made strides every season. This should be a monster year for him -- a chance for his first All-Star appearance. Theyre making noise about a breakneck pace and position-less basketball, but lets see how much of that carries over. The juicier story line is what happens when ownership realizes this team is not nearly as good as they think. A panic trade? A coach firing? A way-too-big commitment to Rudy Gay?\n I just want to say -- your genuine praise of Boogie brought tears to my eyes. This is the best day in Boogie Fanboy Club history other than the time he carried us to the World Cup gold medal over Serbia when we were 33-to-1 favorites.\n Hey, Boogie keeps getting better. Hes a beast. That contract is a steal. He mostly tries on defense now. I know its hard to believe, but trying helps! Hes also the new king of the one-man fast break that could end in disaster for literally every one of the 10 guys on the floor.\n I just want you to know, those two backhanded compliments bounced right off me. BOOGIE!!!!! Anyway, I cant wait for Viveks annual Make-A-Splash trade that will undoubtedly boost this ranking. Do they have the balls to rent Rondo for a few months? Would they roll the dice with Deron Williams? Could this be our David West team? My money is on Deron. Just a gut feeling.\n The Kings trading the farm for a point guard after signing Darren Collison and anointing him the missing piece even though hes not good, then signing Ramon Sessions to play ahead of Ray McCallum, then trading the farm for a point guard -- that would be fantastic. The Nets are optimistic about Williamss ankles, but they should dump him the first chance they get. Rondo on an expiring deal, turning 29 soon and still proving himself post-ACL surgery -- thats one of the trickiest trade pieces ever. And Boston asked for \n in the few initial talks that have happened over the last year or two.\n What about Rondo for the Derrick Williams/Reggie Evans expirings, Ben McLemore and a top-seven-protected 2015 pick? That trade makes the 2015 NBA season 5 percent more fun -- admit it.\n I think Boston would do that. But lets say the cap sticks at the projected $66.3 million for 2015-16, then rises into the mid-$80 million range in 2016-17 -- an outcome that is not a foregone conclusion on either side, by the way. That could present Boston with the chance to re-sign Rondo this summer at a number that ends up looking good. Ive always thought that was the best scenario for them, barring a knockout trade package -- to get Rondo back below the max and use him as a lever to draw the next big star to Boston.\n We agree that Danny Ainge isnt trading Rondo just to trade him. But Minnesota thought it was keeping Kevin Love this summer ... and then, BOOM! Somebody was \n that didnt include the names \"Wiggins\" and \"Bennett\" and the rest was history. The Celts are banking on an out-of-nowhere Rondo suitor to reveal itself. Eventually. Its the right way to play it.\n Or Rondo could take a one-year deal so he could reenter free agency in 2016.\n Stop taunting me.\n Our most shocking League Pass Rankings moment other than us nearly getting into an online fistfight about Charlotte -- you gave the Celts more League Pass points than I did! I gave them 21, you gave them 23. I lost some major homer cred here.\n This is called \"Bill comes to his senses.\" You rated Boston above the Spurs last year.\n You promised me youd never bring that up again.\n Honestly, it was hard to forgive you. But, hey, Boston looks kind of feisty in the preseason, with all the perimeter defense, Jared Sullinger and Kelly Olynyk gunning 3s, and some other fun things! Add Rondo, a great court, and the right dose of Tommy Heinsohn, and they could be watchable, right?\n Its an endearingly bad Celtics team. Brad Stevens truly cares -- he will absolutely try to win all 82 games, even if that makes no sense whatsoever. Marcus Smart is a badass who will become a fan favorite in Boston. Id buy a Smart jersey if I werent in my mid-forties. That Smart-Bradley defensive backcourt will be a nightmare for certain guards. The whole Rondo soap opera is going to be riveting -- not only is he playing for a new deal, he hasnt played in a relevant NBA game since Game 7 of the 2012 Eastern finals, and that has to be gnawing at him. Sullinger has three fun games a month. I cant wait to watch \n. And I think Kelly Olynyk is going to surprise a ton of people. (Did I win my homer street cred back yet?)\n You earned it back. I read that and thought for a second that Boston might win 50 games. Bradley proving that his 3-point percentage last season wasnt a fluke would be huge, because the backcourt is going to feature a ton of guys who cant shoot. Toss in a lack of rim protection and the Cs have two fundamental flaws. But they will still be semi-entertaining!\n No shooting and no rim protection ... ladies and gentlemen, your 2015 NBA lottery winners, the Boston Celtics!\n If youre offering me Bosh, Deng, Chalmers, Josh McBob, a washed-up Granger, a somber Spo and a declining Dwyane Wade, accompanied by empty seats and bummed-out announcers, Im passing if thats OK. If youre offering me a rejuvenated Wade in Eff You Mode trying to reclaim superstardom and doing a reasonable impression of 2011-12 Wade ... Im much more intrigued.\n Thats the thing -- they offer some post-LeBron mystery, but if the big reveal is that this team just isnt very good, wheres the entertainment value? If Wade cant act as a primary off-the-bounce force, they could have huge issues creating offense -- even with a super-smart head coach who will find quirky solutions. Their bench could be horrific. You know its bad when youre reading preseason stories about Udonis Haslem playing extended minutes. Also, \n.\n Heres a clip of Dan Le Batard walking the streets of Miami in February.\nGIVE IT TO ME AGAIN!!!!!!\n We slotted these guys into the exact same spot. We might be shell-shocked a bit from last season, when we thought theyd be entertaining and watched them turn into a flaming poop bag filled with bad jump shots, horrible defense and nonexistent coaching.\n Our best-case scenario for their 2015 League Pass experience: Andre Drummond progressing as a future franchise center ... Brandon Jenningss big comeback season (not kidding, I think its happening) ... SVGs wardrobe ... every replay of SVG reacting to an ill-timed Josh Smith 3 ... solid uniforms, decent court design ... 10-year \n Anniversary Night ... and Tommy Heinsohn saying the words \"Kentavious Caldwell-Pope.\" (Did we rank these guys too low? We might have ranked them too low.)\n Stan Van Gundy is a top-five coach. This team will be frisky, but the Brandon Jennings-Josh Smith combination -- even if they play fewer minutes together -- has reached \"do not trust until you see them do good basketball things\" status.\n Do you think Danny Ferry will be jealous of a team that plays Kyle Singler and Aaron Gray at the same time? Youre right, too soon.\n This team isnt fun to watch, but they destroy the \"minutiae\" category with that awesome-looking court and the single best top-to-bottom announce team in the league.\n I reached my League Pass limit for Joe Johnson and Deron Williams about 20 months ago. And KGs farewell tour and Brook Lopezs make-or-break season arent exactly sucking me in. Why did we rank these guys so high again?\n Because Ian Eagle is a god among mortals.\n I gave them an 8 out of 10 in \"League Pass Minutiae\" for two reasons: Irina Pavlova and Ian Eagle. Between the Joe-Deron backcourt and the way Brooklyn lights its court, youd fall asleep during every Nets game if not for Eagle. I hope Prokhorov is paying him $20 million a year.\n They figure to play slower this season with Brook Lopez back and Paul Pierce gone, but the Mirza Teletovic-Bojan Bogdanovic-Andrei Kirilenko trio offers some weirdo positional versatility. Bad news: Kirilenko started suffering back spasms right when camp started, and he cut his hair.\n When is the Brook Lopez-Larry Sanders trade happening? Do we have an official date? Tell us, Zach -- you know things.\n Well, Jason Kidd supposedly pushed that trade as the Nets coach, and now hes coaching Sanders. The Bucks arent in a rush to sell low on Sanders, and nobody will touch Lopez until he proves his feet arent an issue.\n Sorry, I have to ...\n Giannis, Jabari, Sanders, Ilyasova, Brandon Knight playing for a new deal, Jason Kidd figuring out how hes gonna shank John Hammond and grab control of the whole team, Giannis a second time, Jabari a second time, Mallory Edens plotting her eventual coup detat of Adam Silver to become the NBAs first female commissioner ... I mean, how were they just one point higher than the Nets?\n Well, they sure as hell dont figure into the leagues zeitgeist. And theres an entertainment ceiling for bad teams -- even ones with freakish young guys, a potential Rookie of the Year, a shooting power forward who sort of looks like Frankensteins monster, and the comedy stylings of a hothead who once did this upon ejection:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGEqWkmbxk4\n Hey now.\n The Bucks could, and perhaps should, outperform projections. Even so, they probably wont be playing meaningful games after February 1. And if they are, they might look to trade their way back in the standings. They do have some interesting trade pieces.\n I am picking November 26, 2014, as the day when everyone collectively says, \"Wait, how the hell did Wiggins go ahead of Jabari in the draft?????\" The following is true: Cleveland had the first overall pick in the 2013 and 2014 drafts, but if you redid those drafts, the two Milwaukee guys (Giannis and Jabari) would go first. Bucks fans should be thrilled. They might not be as thrilled three years from now when those guys are playing for the Seattle Bucks ... but right now, they should be thrilled.\n Thats a low blow. The arena issue there got more interesting with the leagues new TV deal, though. Really? Were gonna give another batch of rich dudes another pile of public money?\n Thats part of my 2016 sports czar campaign -- regular citizens will no longer be allowed to fund stadiums for professional sports owners if those owners spent the past two years destroying a players union in a one-sided lockout, creating an owner-friendly salary structure and doubling/tripling the value of their franchises with the latest media rights megadeal. The good people of Wisconsin shouldnt spend ONE PENNY on that new stadium. Tell those billionaires to screw off.\n Actually, heres the team that should move to Seattle.\n Atlanta seems like too big a market to ditch, and the lease and debt agreements would make moving pretty onerous for any buyer.\n Yeah, but still. This years Hawks have some underrated Hoop Nerdgasm potential -- Horford and Millsap playing together, Korver doing Korver things, Coach Budz doing Coach Budz things, the random Mike Scott Heat Check games, and Pero Antic being Pero Antic. Hes replaced Pekovic for me as \"The No. 1 NBA Player Who Should Be In A Liam Neeson Movie.\"\n And yet despite all this -- all the beauty of Mike Budenholzers system, all the talent on hand -- you ranked them 10 spots lower than I did. Nothing divides us like the Hawks and Grizzlies. The Hawks are a delight to watch, and they have an awesome new court. Also, should we call Mike Scott the regional manager? The office manager? Does going by \"Mike\" instead of \"Michael\" invalidate this? The character Michael Scott was awful at basketball, but he was a chucker -- just like Mike Scott!\n Why not just call him \"The Office\"? Would you consider Charlotte a 2015 contender if they flipped Noah Vonleh AND Cody Zeller for Al Horford? Who says no? Sorry ... you know I have to do this every 1,200 words. Its part of my contract.\n I think the precise wording is every 1,200 words and six podcast minutes. But with Horford instead of West, youre getting somewhere. Horford is a better all-around player, and its not even close on defense. Horford could provide at least some rim protection for a team that really needs it, and when you get a dose of rim protection, it opens up new lines of attack defensively. This all assumes that Horford is healthy after two pectoral tears. He could be an interesting trade piece depending on how quickly the ownership situation resolves itself (and what the new bosses want to do). Weve seen a few new owners tank to varying degrees -- including the NBA when it owned New Orleans.\n Two pectoral tears, a racism scandal, a crazy ownership situation and possible tanking ... maybe the Hawks ARE ranked correctly.\n We inadvertently baited the Portland Soccer Moms with this ranking. I can already feel the 625-post \n thread coming. Just remember, Portland fans: Words hurt.\n Your blood feud with Blazers Edge is one of the better ongoing Grantland subplots. Ill say this for Portland fans: I like their particular kind of crazy. It comes from a deep adoration of their only big-four professional team. When a Portland fan accuses you of not having watched all 82 Portland games -- hey, no crap, I cover the whole league -- you at least know that person \n watched all 82 of those suckers. They dont seem angry, theyre not conspiracy theorists, and they dont think the national media hates their team. A great fan base.\n Couldnt agree more. Thats also been one of the five best home crowds, year after year, going back to the Walton era. Only the Jail Blazers soured them -- and think about what THAT took. To me, theyre the role model for one-team city fan bases. But I cant be the only one who was disappointed that the team didnt improve in any way, shape or form this season, right? And dont throw Chris Kaman at me. Just dont.\n Well, they thought they had Spencer Hawes up until the very last second (when he U-turned for the Clips). Kaman is often out of shape, and he went into Byron Mullens Mode last year, starting his shooting motion before he had even really caught a pass. He shot everything. But hes an upgrade in the sense that he can do more than Joel Freeland, Meyers Leonard, and (probably) Thomas Robinson. He should work in Terry Stottss scheme, and hell dial back the chucking now that hes on a good team.\n Sorry, but \"he can do more than Joel Freeland\" didnt exactly get me fired up.\n This is a fine ranking for Portland -- solid team, appealing style, nice court, and ultimately unspectacular. Continuity matters. These guys have played a ton of minutes together and know each other well.\n Id like to see them package $7 million to $13 million of expirings with C.J. McCollum and a first-rounder and get one more impact player. But were nitpicking. (By the way, they DID offer the max to Hibbert once ... and Indiana might blow up its 2014 team, as we discussed earlier. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.)\n Robin Lopez is one of those expiring contracts, and one way or the other, Portland is going hard after a center in the 2015 offseason.\n News flash: A \"Hibbert, George Hill and Donald Sloan for McCollum, Lopez and the Wright-Freeland-Robinson expirings\" \n.\n You ranked them nine spots higher than I did!\n Yup, I was responsible for 31 of these 55 League Pass points. What can I say? Who doesnt want to see Kobe stubbornly jack up 25 shots a game and fight off Father Time? How can you not root for a Nash comeback or Linsanity 2.0? How many times will a wide-open Julius Randle get looked off in the span of six months? What about Byron Scott brazenly antagonizing the advanced-metrics community with his seemingly uneducated hatred of 3s? And is this the worst defensive team ever assembled? How many players will have their career high for points against the 2015 Lakers? I say the over/under is 24.5.\n Is this some kind of homerism by association? Does boosting the Lakers make you feel as if you are boosting the Celtics, since they are both historic giants dealing with a double dose of potential long-term irrelevance? Is this nostalgia?\n The Lakers employ an inordinately high number of players whom I enjoy watching (Aging Kobe, Aging Nash, Linsanity, Randle) or secretly enjoy watching (Xavier Henry, Nick Young, even Bob Sacre). And Ive never NOT enjoyed Carlos Boozer getting overly excited for a relatively mundane basketball moment. Throw in Leo and Jack and Dyan and Flea and I dont know what to tell you.\n All of the above subplots sound wonderful until the Lakers are 15-25 and Boozer is getting minutes over Ed Davis and Randle. Watching an opponent layup line gets old after a while, especially since Robert Sacre can celebrate only Lakers baskets.\n Uh-oh.\n You had them 11 spots lower than me. Eleven. Tony Allen, Marc Gasol, Z-Bo, and a roster of D-League players should rank at least 15th on this entertainment scale. Are you mad that Trick or Treat Tony didnt realize his full potential until he left Boston? Is it Chris Wallace being back in charge? Did you overdose on barbecue during the Western Conference finals two years ago?\n I knew youd be disappointed. Heres my defense: I know what Im getting with the 2015 Grizzlies. Theres no mystery. They havent changed, fundamentally, in five years. Well get to watch them on national TV, and well get to watch them in the playoffs. I dont need to waste huge chunks of League Pass time on them when I could be doing better things ... like watching Stephen Curry drop 67 points on the Lakers.\n But there is intrigue here in Memphis! A lot of front-office personnel with fancy internal projection systems have the Grizzlies as the incumbent Western Conference playoff team most vulnerable to slipping out. That surprised me. They won 50 games last year despite some major injuries, they bring defense every night, and theyre getting some solid wing depth in Vince Carter and the returning Quincy Pondexter. But some of their key players are aging, and projection systems do not like older players.\n Wow, I really regret not ranking them higher.\n Ill never convince you. Im angry. Lets just move on.\n* "}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-annual-nba-league-pass-rankings-part-2/", "blog_text": "The Grantland Basketball Hour\nIf you missed Part 1 of Bill and Zachs 2014-15 League Pass Rankings, as well as the convoluted but strangely effective explanation of their scoring system, \n. Here is Part 2: the top 15 teams.\n I dont enjoy watching Dwight Howard play basketball. Its that simple.\n I still love watching him play defense. He had some \"Holy shit!\" defensive moments in crunch time of that Portland series.\n Great point. I will amend to \"Id rather sit through Season 1 of \n again than watch Dwight Howard play offense.\" But I could see them missing the playoffs for five reasons: Dwights health (you never know), Post-Contract Ariza (in this case, we DO know), no proven bench guys whatsoever (arent they gonna miss Linsanity, or am I crazy?), McHales coaching (sorry, no. 32, you know I love you), and Year 2 of the whole \"Dwight and James are our leaders\" thing (I mean ... come on). Remember, you could finish 48-34 and miss the playoffs in the West. At gunpoint, Id pick the Rockets or Blazers to fall out if I had to pick anyone from last years eight.\n Thats bold. I get the concerns, especially with big-man depth, but its hard to see a team with a healthy Howard-Harden combination missing the playoffs. One of Jeff Adrien and Joey Dorsey will emerge as a useful bench big, Trevor Ariza will fit in, and Terrence Jones should take another leap. The real reason theyre this low on my scale: their interminable parade to the foul line, and the leagues most homerific, anti-referee, anti-3-point-shot broadcast crew.\n Can we at least agree that the Rockets could finish as a top-12 team that still misses the playoffs?\n Id say this: Theyre a playoff team that is one serious injury from being a lottery team. But you can say that for anyone outside the Thunder-Spurs-Clippers trio atop the West.\n For the record, I will always dislike the decision to let Chandler Parsons leave. That three-year offer sheet made him untradable? Fine. Year 1, youre not dealing him, anyway. Year 2, its a fair number with salaries going haywire. And Year 3, the salary cap is going to be roughly $400 million per team. Im not selling my Dork Elvis Fan Club membership or anything, but I thought he whiffed on that one. Well, unless he knows hes getting Rondo. (And he might.)\n The real killer was letting Parsons out of his deal one year early, though theres a near-100 percent chance that doing so was part of the price Houston paid for Dwight Howard. (Dan Fegan represents both players.)\n Im going with a 100 percent chance.\n The next year is big for Houston. Parsonss megadeal would have prevented them from opening up major room this summer, but with the cap set to soar in 2016-17, they could have kept Parsons and still had max-level room in the summer of 2016. So in the summer of 2015, the salary downgrade from Parsons to Ariza could really make a difference in free agency. (It will always make a difference in the trade market, of course -- even as soon as this season.)\n So unless they sign Rondo (not unrealistic), Kevin Love (unlikely), Aldridge (makes no sense for them) or Marc Gasol (ditto), suddenly theyre looking at overpaying Paul Millsap, Arron Afflalo, David West, Luol Deng or Ricky Rubio or else theyll regret letting Parsons leave? I dont like their chances here -- and I dont like losing assets for nothing.\n You dont think Aldridge would theoretically make sense as their Chris Bosh fallback?\n Nice, you took me off the hook with the Portland Soccer Moms!\n This is our last certain lottery team, and theyre up this high because of you.\n Why, thank you. Good news, Minnesota fans ... even though you havent made the playoffs in 10 years, youre our highest-ranked League Pass lottery team by far! Pour some skunked champagne over each others heads!\n I ranked them 11 spots lower than you, so Im here to be the buzzkill: This team has some exciting pieces, particularly the young dunkers, but that doesnt necessarily translate into exciting 48-minute NBA basketball games. Zach LaVine has looked overwhelmed in preseason, and Andrew Wiggins is facing stiff veteran competition for minutes -- unless/until Flip Saunders The GM trades one of Corey Brewer, Chase Budinger, or (least likely) Kevin Martin. Its a lock that Cleveland and Minnesota will have calls about trading Brewer into the Keith Bogans Memorial Trade Exception.\n LaVine looking overwhelmed in the preseason was a bigger lock than me ranking the T-Wolves too high. Come on, youre not a wee bit excited to watch the T-Wolves?\n Its weird -- I like watching Rubio, Thad Young, and Nikola Pekovic, and the young guys are fun. Im just not sure the collective will be as fun as the individual parts. The court is ugly, but the top-notch broadcasting duo of Dave Benz and Jim Petersen earns points. I learn something every game.\n Im excited to start developing a fully formed opinion of Wiggins. (Can he become this generations T-Mac? Is he a poor mans T-Mac? Is he a bankrupt T-Mac?) Im excited for Rubios contract year. Im excited for Shabazz Muhammad and Anthony Bennett being in \n. Im excited for every Gorgui Dieng 20-10-5 game that makes me regret trashing Minnesotas 2013 draft-day trade, but still. Im excited for lots and lots and lots of dunks and alley-oops. Im even excited for the whiff of post-Kevin Love Ewing Theory potential. Its just too bad theyre stuck in the West.\n I cant believe I forgot about Gorgui! Hes going to be fun, and Minny will at least toy with playing Dieng and Pekovic together. Im not sure the Ewing Theory will apply, but I can tell you this: The franchise is very eager to prove it can succeed without Love. That relationship was borderline poisonous by the end.\n \"They could trade Bismack Biyombo straight up for David West and I still dont think theyre a contender.\" --Zach Lowe.\n Alert to sloppy news aggregators: I DID NOT SAY THIS!\n You thought it -- its the same thing. These guys intrigue me because they can play defense, they have a crunch-time guy who needs to be double-teamed, and they just slapped together one of the NBAs all-time irrational-confidence backcourts. Lance and Kemba?!?!?!? They even have an irrational-confidence owner! These guys wont back down from anyone -- especially naysayers like you, Zach Lowe.\n Charlotte jumped 12 spots over last years League Pass ranking, and it feels right. Professor Al is a joy, and Lance Stephenson upped their score in both individual appeal and unintentional-comedy potential. Toss in a solid announce team and arguably the leagues best court, and the Hornets have arrived.\n My four big questions that I hope to solve while watching a little too much of them: Can Kemba become the Eastern Conferences version of Damian Lillard? Can the Vonleh-Zeller combo give them 30-35 minutes of young legs and athleticism? Can Lance be functionally crazy instead of dysfunctionally crazy? And can MKG make the leap into ... I dont know, an elite defender who cant be left wide open offensively for 48 minutes a night?\n Kemba needs to shoot 3s well before we can put him in the same conversation with Lillard. MKGs remade jumper looks nice, but we have to see if its real. I hope it is. Dude could be a better Tony Allen -- an elite perimeter defender who can be hyper-aggressive and perfectly balanced at the same time. Thats a hard double to pull, and he wont be able to pull it in big minutes if hes a total zero shooting the ball.\n Youre souring me on Charlotte. Stop throwing facts and hard evidence at me. Just stop.\n Sorry.\n Anthony Davis, Anthony Davis, and Anthony Davis. Oh, and Anthony Davis. Did I forget anything?\n Monty Williamss suits! Ryan Anderson is back! I wish I enjoyed watching their perimeter players half as much as their big guys. I wish all three of Davis, Anderson, and Omer Asik could play at the same time -- and Williams will likely give that at least a token early shot. But something about watching Tyreke Evans and Eric Gordon ...\n Those guys definitely fail the \"Would It Be Fun To Play With Him?\" test. But Davis, Asik and Jrue Holiday ... thats a pretty nice start. I wish we could bring Don Nelson out of his Hawaii hibernation to coach these guys. Theres a legitimately entertaining style lurking somewhere in here. Lets just say that I dont trust Monty Williams to unleash it.\n I kind of trust him. He runs some funky stuff on offense, even if too much of it results in midrange jumpers. Thats part of the reason its good to have Anderson back -- he really opens up their playbook. They were a solid offensive team last season, and lights-out when they had all their guys. The defense is the bigger question, though its hard to be even below-average with Asik and Brow.\n Would you trade Nerlens Noel, Elfrid Payton and a 2015 late lottery pick for Holiday and one year of Asik? Because thats what New Orleans did. Yikes. Then again, in all caps, THIS TEAM HAS ANTHONY DAVIS ON IT! So who cares?\n Theres a very strong chance those deals will end up on the bad side of the ledger in the aggregate, and they are part of the reason the Pelicans have no depth. The rising cap might help them, since they should have flexibility at some point to add another cog. Small-market teams are nervous about banking enough revenue to spend well over the cap when it gets into the $100 million range down the line, but the TV deal and a revamped revenue-sharing system should empower that sort of spending.\n Infinitely more fun on the Trade Machine than League Pass. Do you realize they have $28 million worth of Johnson/Fields/Hayes/Williams/Hansbrough expirings? My God. I need to take a long shower and regroup.\n Hold on, hold on. Amir Johnson is really good! Lou Williams is the king of the 2-for-1, non-Chris Paul division. Tyler Hansbrough might be a psychopath! Their GM dropped the F-bomb at a public rally!\n Good work, Im back in on T-Dot. You needed only 35 words to sway me.\n These guys are fun! They carry over almost the entirety of a team that was really good. Lowry-DeRozan is a legit top-five NBA backcourt, and Im pumped for Year 3 of Jonas Valanciunas. He has issues defensively around the rim and hell pump-fake himself into the ground on offense, but the guy can flat score on the block. Get onboard, unless you hate Canada.\n How dare you. I love Canada, I love Canada Dry, I love the Canadian national anthem, I love Canadians, I love Lorne Michaels, I love Steve Nash, I love hockey ... (this could go on for 1,750 more words, so Ill stop).\n A.k.a. the 2015 Washington Professional Basketball Team! Guys, you had me at hello. You didnt have to go and sign Paul Pierce. You had me at hello.\n I do not endorse this nickname. I do endorse John Wall fast breaks, Bradley Beal stretching his game, Nenes passing and angry dunks, everything about Marcin Gortat, and Paul Pierce already getting four guys suspended and nearly smushing poor Tom Thibodeau in a Pierce-Joakim Noah sandwich. DeJuan Blair and Kris Humphries were sneaky good signings, and Professor Miller, PhD, is still holding office hours down in the low post for all you suckas. Maybe this team should be higher?\n I think youre right. We did our rankings before we found out that Americas Team wants to thug it up and embrace the spirit of the Bad Boy Pistons. Its a great idea. Maybe they cant beat Cleveland in a talent show, but they can beat them up inside, use their depth to wear them down, and maybe rattle them with the whole hard fouls/trash-talking/eyeballing routine. It just cant be forgotten how many key Cavs have never been in a seven-game war. Thats their biggest issue in my opinion.\n I was just having this conversation with a front-office guy the other day. Sometimes you get so deep in the weeds, you forget about the obvious stuff: Clevelands second- and third-best players have never been to the playoffs.\n By the way, I would have picked Americas Team for the Finals if I hadnt watched Randy Wittman coach last spring, or if I hadnt seen John Wall trying (and failing) to run a half court offense against a tough defense in Round 2. Theyre a year away unless Bradley Beal comes back from that broken wrist and makes \"The Leap.\" (INJURY GODS -- LEAVE BRADLEY BEAL ALONE!!!!) And even then, theyre a Washington pro sports team, which means theyre destined to choke in the playoffs to a less talented team in the worst possible way. (Cut to Dan Steinberg and Joe House nodding sadly.)\n I thought Wittman did a nice job against Chicago in the playoffs with some Xs-and-Os tweaks that worked, but yeah, the jury is still out.\n I notice you didnt mention the Indiana series.\n The only bad thing about Washington being good: No more of Steve Buckhantz, their play-by-play guy, being unable to hide his anguish during broadcasts. I loved that. \"Nick Young shoots ... and its another miss.\"\n We ranked them no. 30 before last season. Thats one of the biggest mistakes in Grantland history.\n Its right up there with Andrew Sharp telling Mallory Rubin in our L.A. office that he hated two things in life: cats and baseball. He now lives in Washington, D.C. You dont mess with Mallory Rubin.\n To be fair, I had the 2013 Suns ranked higher than you, but we were both so, so far off. In our defense, I dont think anyone \n for the Suns expected them to be so entertaining, let alone to snag 48 wins. They wont catch anyone off-guard this season, and the loss of Channing Fryes deadly pick-and-pop game will cramp their spacing. But theyll be fun as long as they run like hell with dual point guard lineups, and Im all in on Markieff Morris as a jack-of-all-trades at power forward. Plus, Alex Len might play if he stops breaking bones in his hand. Eric Bledsoes brutality, Goran Dragics trickery ... I love these guys.\n Ditto. I love that Jeff Hornacek basically came out and said (Im paraphrasing), \n I get the feeling that the dual point guard lineup IS their offense. Dragic, Bledsoe, Isaiah Thomas, even Tyler Ennis ... I could see two or three of them playing for 90 percent of these games. Three point guards at once?!?!?!? I mean, why not? Its never going to be an elite defensive team, so their offense becomes their defense -- that pace they create is going to suck opponents into their breakneck vortex. Over 82 games, thats a nightmare for everyone else. Well, except LeBron and Love, Durant and Westbrook, and everyone on Golden State. I think theyll have a GREAT time in these games.\n Gerald Greens nutty heat checks are perfect for this team, though it wouldnt shock me if they traded him at some point. For now, enjoy the ride, with narration from the great Steve Albert.\n And Thomas is a potential heat checker, too! I love his 2003 Nick Van Exel/Mavericks potential for them. He should shave his head, wear no. 31 and study YouTube clips like this one.\n He might have the best hesitation dribble in the league. So fun to watch.\n I never expected them to score this highly, but man ... MSG, Carmelo (our most divisive NBA star), Phil Jackson is-he-awake-or-napping shots, Earl Smith III, Jose Calderons offense (perpetually underrated), Jose Calderons ghastly defense (properly rated), Derek Fishers expensive suits, the goofy celeb shots, the Spike-Phil feud, the classic uniforms, the storied history (a history of six Finals appearances in 68 years, but still), the first-class TV production, Clydes outfits, the MSG crowd during a big game, and, of course, the comedy of Amares Expiring and Bargnanis Expiring bouncing around and roping me into yet another Trade Machine session.\n You nailed it. This team isnt very good, but everything around it is splendid or funny -- or both. Its only preseason, and Amare is reminding everyone to stay off \n he and Bargnani own. And we havent even mentioned the Mike Breen-Clyde Frazier broadcast duo, or Pablo Prigioni sneaking around for steals in the backcourt. It feels right to have the triangle back in our lives.\n And if thats not enough, Rondo \n. I factored in a possible Rondo trade for my ranking: Shumpert, Amares expiring, a 2018 no. 1 and one protected pick swap at some point before the year 2275 for Rondo and Gerald Wallace. CALL IT IN, ZACH! CALL IT IN RIGHT NOW!!!!!!\n Its not like the Knicks have ever traded all their good assets in exchange for a superstar they could just sign in free agency a few months later. (Wait ... ) This is a new Knicks era. Theyve been more careful building for the future. They actually made a trade last summer in which they were the team acquiring draft picks. The Knicks! Rondo is basically the polar opposite of a triangle point guard, and thats another variable that shrinks his trade market for Boston.\n Im always dumbfounded when NBA teams make decisions based on the \"system\" of some coach or GM who might not be around in three years. Doesnt it make more sense to acquire the best talent you can find, then build the right system around that talent? (Sorry, I cant let this Knicks thing go -- its Bostons best chance for a Rondo overpay. Just humor me.)\n We did these rankings before Durant broke his foot, but I cant decide if letting Westbrook run wild for 15 or 20 games might somehow make the Thunder more watchable -- at least until we get tired of the Westbrook Show.\n I hate losing Durant for six to eight weeks from League Pass exactly as much as I love Westbrook saying night after night, \"Dont worry, guys, I got this.\" Maybe its a wash.\n We might see Westbrook crack 30 field goal attempts in one or two games.\n Or 12. In general, Id boycott the Thunder if I didnt love watching Durant and Westbrook so much. We just watched the Thunder miss the Finals because OKC had to play a washed-up Derek Fisher, in crunch time, in its biggest playoff games. What happened this summer? They turned two 2014 first-rounders, some cap space and Kendrick Perkinss Expiring Contract into Mitch McGary, Anthony Morrow, a D-Leaguer, and Kendrick Perkinss Expiring Contract. Anthony Morrow. That was your big move, OKC???? Zach -- \n for me.\n Umm ... Wow. This just got serious. Look, using a first-round pick on Josh Huestis and sending him to the D-League would grate a bit if I were Durant. Thats one potential contributor down the drain until next season. But the Thunder have a ton of unproven young guys, and theyre only about $2 million below the tax line. Paying the rookie scale for Huestis and signing someone with the full midlevel would have taken them over the tax -- and hard-capped them.\nThis is the part where you mention that they could, you know, just pay the tax.\n They could just pay the tax.\n And two years ago, they traded Harden to duck it. But with the cap and tax climbing, they \n. They are concerned about the roster-building restrictions that come with paying the tax, but your point is fair. Also, their TV guys have become increasingly aggressive homers as the team has gotten better and better. They have an \"us against the world\" tone that almost makes me uncomfortable. The court and jerseys are horrific.\n And also, they could have, you know, just paid the tax. The good news is, Clay Bennett and Aubrey McClendon will probably clear $40 million in profit this season. When is someone selling #freedurant T-shirts? I want one.\n [\n]\n This feels high. It feels optimistic. Im nervous.\n Its definitely a deeper and more talented team than the 62-win Bulls from four seasons ago ... but that team starred Derrick Rose when he was a 10 out of 10 on the Athletic Freak Scale. Will he ever play that fearlessly and that recklessly again? So basically ... I dont know.\n I love me some Chicago Bulls defense, and the three key supplementary pieces Chicago nabbed in Pau Gasol, Nikola Mirotic (drilling off-the-dribble 3s in preseason!), and Doug McDermott could help Tom Thibodeau expand a stale playbook. But half of that playbook stays closed if Derrick Rose isnt healthy enough to dominate. Fingers crossed. Watching Thibodeau juggle the offense/defense elements of his four-man frontcourt will be fascinating.\n Heres another Eastern team that can knock the young Cavs around and get into their heads. But they also have more unanswered questions than any other contender. Can Taj Gibson jump a level? Can McDermott and Mirotic guard ANYONE? What are they getting from Rose? Was Pau on cruise control during the Lakers/DAntoni era, or is Pau more washed-up than we realize? Can you play Pau and Noah at the same time? Intriguing -- all of it. We should have ranked these guys higher.\n I think well see a lot of the Pau-Noah combination, and the high-post passing will definitely produce some Hoop Nerdgasms. And I might be the last guy on the Neil Funk-Stacey King corner. I find them funny, and there is some old-school broadcasting gravel in Funks play-by-play voice. Like, I can picture him going out for whiskey with Jerry Sloan back in the day.\n Im with you on Neil and Stacey. And dont tell anyone, but Im secretly pumped to watch McDermott. I love anyone and everyone with 25-foot range. Its why I loved Curry so much before the 2009 draft. Its also why I got stuck holding all this Jimmer stock. You want any?\n [\n]\n We both had them in the same spot. It feels right. Dirk is still Dirkilicious, Rick Carlisles flow offense is gorgeous when well executed, and the front office is good at finding creative drive-and-kick guys who can execute it well.\n If Carlisle could figure out how to use Monta Freaking Ellis, hes DEFINITELY figuring out the perfect way to use Chandler Parsons. Because Houston never totally figured it out. By the way, I love that Chandlers weight goes up and down just like Chandler Bings weight did on \n They lose some shooting and beardy zest with Jose Calderon gone, and DeJuan Blair and Shawn Marion were exactly the sort of strange square pegs who also fit the rightly shaped holes. But Brandan Wright and his giant arms are still here, and Carlisle will find cool stuff for Jae Crowder (looking beastly in preseason), Al-Farouq Aminu, and maybe even Greg Smith. Tyson Chandlers snarling dunk celebrations are the best, and he has a nice two-way synergy with Dirk.\n The whole thing sounds Dirkilicious. Thats the greatest name for an NBA blog that hasnt happened yet.\n You came to your senses! Look at San Antonio, tied for no. 4 overall -- and a strong no. 6 on your ballot!\n Last year, I thought Id be bored of them from a League Pass standpoint. Turns out its never boring to watch offensive basketball played beautifully and brilliantly.\n Theres nothing more to say about these guys, other than that we need to savor what could be the final season for both Duncan and Manu.\n And maybe our final season for Parker as an elite playmaker (very quietly, its Year 14 for him!!!) and Boris Diaw playing at the right weight. I love watching Boris as long as hes an A-cup. My biggest question: How will they remain motivated after last season? How do you top redeeming one of the worst sports defeats ever, winning the NBA title at home AND murdering the LeBron era in Miami? Theres some decent letdown potential hanging over this season. Then again, who cares?\n This whole section should really just be the Spursgasm GIF from their Game 6 win over Oklahoma City last season -- the best possession of the year:\n Lets pour out a 40 for the 2013 League Pass champs.\n The king is dead, and Im not sure why. The broadcast looks and sounds as good as ever with Jim Barnett back, Steph Curry is still a #LeaguePassAlert founding star, and Steve Kerr promises to make the most of all the passing here. Shaun Livingston brings even more of that, plus a post-up game that gives a team lacking off-the-bounce drivers another way to get the ball inside. Andrew Bogut will be up to his usual dirty tricks and expert rim protection. Did we subconsciously avoid a repeat?\n No way. They were leapfrogged by two better choices. Simple as that. Theyre rerunning everything we loved about last years squad, only Livingstons versatility makes them even more entertaining (especially when they play him with Curry and Thompson). Im semi-intrigued to follow Thompsons whole \"Wait a second ... youre the reason we didnt get Kevin Love???????\" subplot that kicks off in late November once the Love-LeBron pairing blows everyone away. (And thats happening.)\n Klay has looked great for Team USA and in the preseason. I wrote that they should have pulled the trigger, but this has a chance to be an all-time NBA \"What if ... ?\" Oh well -- no. 3 is still damn good. This team is a must-watch.\n And we didnt even mention Steve Kerr dusting off his coaching PhD from Pop College and Phil University. I cant wait to see him improve their ball movement, argue with referees, conduct in-game interviews and try desperately to remain composed during every Curry heat check. How do we have two NBA teams more entertaining than this one?\n You love these guys. You get to watch them in person a lot, which means you dont have to listen to Michael Smiths schoolgirl gushing on television.\n Plus, I sit right across from Ballmers seats, so I can gawk at him as hes behaving like a heavier, balder Bob Sacre in real time. I put the Clips over the Warriors for three reasons. First, they feature more day-to-day dunks, alley-oops and general WHOA moments. Second, I think theyre making the 2015 Finals. And third, give me in-the-moment Ballmer reactions over in-the-moment Joe Lacob reactions every day of the week and twice on Sunday.\n Yeah, this isnt rocket science. These guys have been awesome to watch since the league shipped them Chris Paul, and they became more interesting last season once Griffin seized some of the playmaking duties. And now hes stroking 3s in preseason!\n Hes the best value pick for MVP at 12-to-1. I mean, you should always, always, always, ALWAYS wager on LeBron with these things. (Hes even odds right now.) But if the Clippers win 60-plus games and grab a top-two seed, those Blake odds would be a helluva hedge. You dont think about these things because youre the NBA Spock, and Vulcans dont gamble.\n I used to gamble. The anxiety outweighed the rush of winning for me. Im not sure either Blake or Paul will ever win an MVP as long as the other is around and healthy for most of the season. They are such equal partners now that its hard to separate them. Watching how Spencer Hawes fits with Contract Year DeAndre Jordan will be fun. Doc is going to give that double-barreled center look a go.\n They better reinforce the rims at Staples to be safe.\n If youre into drinking games, try taking a drink every time Hedo Turkoglu licks his hands. Two sips when someone mauls Griffin under the rim, he reacts with that stoic stare, and all of Twitter somehow blames Griffin. Chug when Matt Barnes does something insane. And then just be ready to dial 911.\n And if you want to stay sober, then drink every time Ballmer DOESNT have a maniacally giddy reaction to any Blake home dunk. I cant tell you how much more fun its going to be to have a benevolently wacky billionaire owner at these Clippers home games over the Guy Who Shall Not Be Named who dressed in all black, ordered people around, cheaped out for decades, didnt care about the fans and happened to be a sullen, potbellied racist.\n Youre practically giddy over David Blatt.\n I like NBA coaches who (a) try shit, and (b) \n. Im that easy.\n Ive said enough about these guys. They are going to be dynamite to watch. A big man like Kevin Love -- someone with legit range who can pass, screen and dribble -- is a dream toy for Blatt.\n And LeBron! In 11 years, LeBron played with only one elite player who made him better: Dwyane Wade in 2011 and most of 2012 before he slowly turned into Heavier, Moodier, Not-As-Good Dwyane Wade. Kevin Love will make LeBron better every single game. Remember, LeBron has never -- not in his entire life -- played with a great rebounder, a great outlet passer, or a great pick-and-roll forward. Never. Not ever. I cant wait to watch them. I want to upgrade my score to a perfect 50. Is it too late?\n Youre short-changing Bosh as a pick-and-pop guy who gave LeBron space to work and defended his tail off in Miami.\n Bosh was a very good pick-and-pop partner for LeBron. Love could be a GREAT pick-and-pop partner for LeBron. Thats my defense.\n Regardless, it will be fascinating to see how democratic the Cavs can really make their offense, how they upgrade their roster, and how Blatt manages his defense. Blatt is talking about switching up tactics depending on matchups and lineups. That kind of toggling has gone out of style. Coaches have gravitated toward \"Pick one system, drill it to death and execute it.\" Going against the grain is risky, especially with so many younger guys who arent good at defense.\n And what happens when Varejao gets hurt? If anyone out there thinks the Cavs are getting 100 games out of Anderson Varejao over the next eight months, I have some Pets.com stock to sell you. These guys still need a rim protector, but I think they know it.\n They get the top spot in spite of the ugliest uniform/court design combination in the league. Thats how excited we are for these guys. I can hear Austin Carr cackling from 500 miles away.\n I didnt love their other offseason moves. Shawn Marion looked just about done as a playoff guy last year. Same for Ray Allen (if they get him). Mike Miller is a beloved teammate, but you might get one good playoff game per round from him. James Jones ... blah. Brendan Haywood ... blah. But you know which two moves I really liked? When they landed the leagues best player and the leagues second-best power forward.\n The cascading series of lucky breaks they needed to pull all that off, starting with the location of LeBrons birth, is legitimately unbelievable.\n One other thing -- every 2015 Cavs home game is going to be appointment viewing. Even the ones against Philly and Utah. Everyone forgets how fantastic their home games were in 2009 and 2010, how much energy ripped through that building every night, and how LeBron always seemed to feed off his hometown peeps. They went 39-2 at home in 2009 with inferior talent, a clueless coach and a roster that couldnt do 40 percent of the stuff that this 2015 Cavs team can do. These LeBron 2.0 home games are going to be a borderline religious experience. I really believe that. Its just one of many reasons why theyre our 2015 League Pass champs."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/week-8-picks-a-gambling-epiphany/", "blog_text": "The last time I wrote a Friday football column -- 35 days ago, if youre keeping score -- Washington fans thought they had upgraded from RG3 to Kirk Cousins, Bills fans were dreaming about EJ Manuel leading them to the Super Bowl, Seattle fans believed a healthy Percy Harvin would propel them to a repeat, and Cowboys fans were dreading their umpteenth straight 8-8 season. As the old saying goes, the NFL really stands for Not For Long. Just think -- five weeks ago, Adrian Petersons football career was up in the air, the NFL didnt have a foolproof plan to deal with domestic violence, and Roger Goodell was going to give a full account of what actually happened during the Ray Rice scandal.\n(Thinking.)\nOK, maybe not everything is different. But its good to be back. Thanks to Bill Barnwell for carrying this space for four straight Fridays -- it was like watching Josh McCown putting up monster stats in Jay Cutlers place in 2013, only if McCown were  younger and more talented. Barnwell did a fantastic job and I couldnt have been prouder. But now ... get ready for some picks, some fumbles, some pouting, some horrendous body language and yet another mediocre season. BECAUSE JAY CUTLER SIMMONS IS BACK!\nMy \"hiatus\" was productive for a variety of reasons. First, I found out that I have two kids and a wife -- apparently we were living in the same house and everything. Who knew?\nSecond, my long-dormant golf game improved dramatically. I hadnt played more than five rounds total in the past 20 years; two weeks ago, I shot a 94 from the blues. At this rate, I will be playing the Masters by next April.\nThird, you know whats really fun about not working? \n Being a lazy-ass is just incredible. I loved it so much. \nAnd fourth, I rededicated myself to understanding football gambling better. I mean, why not? What else was I going to do? One morning, I was killing time power-walking on a treadmill before a doubleheader of \n and \n when I came up with a gambling brainstorm: What if there were a better way to figure out NFL records than just wins and losses? For instance, Arizona battled back in Week 1 to beat San Diego 18-17 on Monday night -- the Cardinals got the \"win\" and San Diego got the \"loss,\" but really, that was an \"either/or\" game, right? For gambling purposes, there had to be a better way to capture that.\nI went through the first few weeks of games and redid everyones records, tagging each game as either a legitimate win or loss, an ass-kicking win or loss, or an either/or game. And if anything else happened in that game with gambling repercussions -- a comeback win, a blown lead, major dysfunction, whatever -- I tagged that, too. And again, I did this because I had an incredible amount of time on my hands.\nSo Buffalo might be 4-3 in real life, but its revised record would be 1-2-4 -- one legit win, two legit losses and four either/or games.\nLooks a little different than just \"4-3,\" right? The Bills are also 16th in DVOA (29th offensively and fourth defensively); they just lost their best two running backs; theyre minus-19 in first downs (123-142); and theyre averaging only 16.6 points these past five weeks. This week, theyre going against a 1-4-2 Jets team that has played a tougher schedule (last six weeks: Packers, Bears, Lions, Chargers, Broncos, Pats). Add everything up and taking the Jets -- at home, giving a field goal -- looks smart even after you remember that theyre the Jets and youre backing Geno Smith.\nOne more example: Check out the Colts ...\nThat Week 1 loss looks better in retrospect when you remember how well Indy played in the second half, and how splendidly Denver has played since. That Week 2 Eagles loss was ridiculous; if Luck gets that no-brainer pass interference call in the fourth, they win it. After that, they kicked ass for FIVE straight weeks. And the smarter numbers back it up: Theyre in the top 10 in all three DVOA categories (eighth in offense, ninth in defense, fourth in special teams); they have the ball for 37 minutes a game; theyre an astonishing plus-64 on first downs (187 to 123); theyre 44 percent on third-down conversions (compared to 26 percent for their opponents); they have led by double figures in each of the past six games; and theyve thrown for a dominating 806 yards more than their opponents.\nLook at it from every angle and its hard not to come to this conclusion: The 2014 Colts are REALLY good. Oh, and I havent even mentioned the most important point: You dont want to face Andrew Luck in a big game, under any circumstances. Hes been dynamite. Quarterbacks usually make four leaps ...\n \"Im definitely a playoff QB.\"\n\n\n \"Im definitely a franchise QB.\"\n\n\n \"I can win a Super Bowl for you.\"\n\n\n \"I AM A BEAST! YOU WILL FUCKING FEAR ME!!!!!!\"\nI cant tell if Luck is making Leap 3 in 2014, or if he just decided to combine Leap 3 and Leap 4 into one mega-leap. But SOMETHING is happening here. Because I can tell you this much: As a Patriots fan, I want no part of Andrew The Giant in the playoffs. None. Zero. Nada.\nOK, lets do a quick 2014 power ranking, in reverse order, using everyones revised records (legit wins, legit losses, either/or games).\nYour top five for the 2015 draft in some order. The Vikings might have mild \"frisky November/December gambling underdog\" potential once they get healthy and Teddy Bridgewater gets going, but thats it. Also, you could talk me into moving all five of these teams to London for the rest of the season. Seriously -- Atlanta, dont come back next week.\nTake it from a Pats fan who rooted for the likes of Hugh Millen, Matt Cavanaugh and Traumatized By Super Bowl XX Tony Eason -- theres nothing worse than being stuck with a subpar-or-worse QB. Its the same feeling as the few hours after losing your wallet, but every Sunday for four straight months. Short-term, couldnt these teams just make a four-way Geno/Cousins/Locker/Fitzpatrick trade just to mix it up?\nI dont believe in any of these teams, with one exception: You cant rule out the Bears getting out of their own way and ripping off some wins. They have two Vikings games, a Bucs game and home games against Dallas, New Orleans and Detroit left ... and I hate to say it, but they scare the shit out of me in New England this weekend. (Wait, you just smelled out my elaborate jinx? Crap, Im rusty.)\nJust a whiff. Not quite a strong odor. For the record, they play each other in Week 13. And for the record, Mike Lombardi signed Brian Hoyer and traded Trent Richardsons carcass for a first-rounder well before anyone realized Trent Richardson was a carcass ... and yes, he absolutely would have kept that no. 4 overall pick and drafted Sammy Watkins last May. Whatever.\nIn Week 10, the Niners and Saints have the Season From Hell Bowl to decide whos actually having the Season From Hell. So stay tuned for that. Meanwhile, Im not giving up on the Bengals yet -- lets wait until A.J. Green comes back before we pour dirt on those guys. Remember, the NFL season doesnt REALLY start until November.\nTwo flawed playoff teams with the same fundamental problem -- if Megatron or Gronk isnt 90-100 percent in January, they have no chance. Cross them off. Without Gronk, New Englands offense is a bunch of .280 hitters with .740 OPSes; and it might not matter, anyway, after the Mayo/Ridley/Jones injuries. And the Lions have more weapons, but would you rather have Matt Stafford and Jim Caldwell ... or Brady and Belichick? Come on.\nJust a textbook Super Bowl hangover season. Im officially in \"Are we sure theyre good?\" mode with them. (Youll see where I settled later in the column.) By the way, Pete Carroll turned out to be a terrific peacetime president ... but you dont want him as your wartime president. Every Patriots fan knew this already. Myself included.\nLove the way both teams are playing. Miami should have beaten Green Bay, and they absolutely housed the Bears. Tannehill looked fantastic last week -- repeat: FANTASTIC. And the Chiefs hung with Denver and San Francisco, won in San Diego, annihilated the Pats and Dolphins and have the Rams/Jets/Bills/Steelers and two Oakland games left. Thats right, we all have a legitimate chance to wager against Andy Reid in the playoffs again. Im giddy.\nSimilar teams in this respect: superb coaching staffs that spent time \"creating a culture,\" playmakers on offense, overachievers on defense, good home crowds, helmets with birds ... and I dont even remotely trust their QBs. Ironically, theyre playing each other on Sunday! (Was that the right use of \"ironically?\" I botch that word 75 percent of the time.) \nSan Diego might be ranked too high, but I like those guys and theyre undeniably banged up right now. Even last night in Denver, they were in that game until they got jobbed by putrid officiating. Theyll be heard from in January. Meanwhile, Aaron Rodgers is playing out of his mind; the Ravens have been lights-out at home and theyre a top-10 team in all three DVOA categories, even if theyre last in the Karma DVOA category that doesnt exist; and I love how the Cowboys are playing offensively, but I dont trust their defense even a little and you cant make me. So there.\nWeek 11, home for Brady and the Pats -- thats when well know with these guys one way or the other. I am a believer.\nShaping up to be a historically great juggernaut, \n even before last nights San Diego win. I see them finishing 14-2 overall -- theyll lose in San Diego or Kansas City, but thats it. And if Manning cant win the Super Bowl with THIS team, then I dont know what to tell you.\nOne more thing: Before we get to the Week 8 picks, I wanted to clear up my 2014 record against the spread. After three weeks, I was sitting at 25-23 ... and then I didnt make picks in this space for four weeks. So whats my real record?\nWell, if Roger Goodell can claim that Ray Rice deceived him on June 16, or that Goodell didnt know what was on that second elevator tape, then Im claiming that I went 58-0 against the spread from Week 4 through Week 7.\nHere are the Week 8 picks ...\n(HOME TEAMS IN CAPS)\n\nI swear on the lives of both of my dogs, I picked the Broncos in this one. Going against Manning at home in a Thursday-night game? Come on. Lets run some mean Manning emails to make me feel better about where this Broncos season is going.\n\n\n\n\nBS: (Biting my tongue.)\nBS: I mean ...\n\nThis line is three points too high. Im taking solace in the whole \"I could see the Bears dominating for 56 minutes as the Pats improbably hang around, then Cutler doing something dumb in the final four minutes, then Brady winning it with 20 seconds left\" scenario that every Bears fan is dreading right now. By the way, you should be VERY happy that you didnt get to read me and listen to me after Week 4, when I was getting emails like this one ...\nBS: Brady landed on the waiver wire for my East Coast fantasy league for like 36 hours. It was incredible. Absolutely, unequivocally, the rock-bottom moment of the entire Brady-Belichick era. (Thinking.) Wait, thats not true. We lost a Super Bowl because the Giants fifth-string receiver caught a third down pass off his helmet. I forgot. But I couldnt believe the sight of TOM FREAKING BRADY sitting on the waiver wire with the likes of Toby Gerhart and Geno Smith. Yes, I picked him up. Yes, hes starting for me this week.\nBS: Remember, the 2014 Pats are 2-0 when we run a mean Brady-related email from Eric in NYC!\nBS: Thats a good one! Youre saying Jay Cutler ruins the atmosphere, basically -- so his nickname should be something like \"Global Warming\" or \"The Global Warmer\"? Im in. Now watch him throw six touchdowns this weekend. Dammit.\n\nLondon, 9:30 a.m. ET, 6:30 a.m. PT ... thats right, its the dumbest sporting event of the year! Plus, we kept our streak alive of sending England the crappiest NFL games possible. Im waking up early and watching this only because I hate myself. That reminds me ...\nBS: Two words: the Lions! No Super Bowl appearances. Decades and decades of losing. Theyve never had a great coach, and their last superstar QB (Bobby Layne) retired in 1962. Their most iconic player abruptly retired during his prime. And they havent even blown enough memorable games that their fans can claim theyre tortured. Theyre just kinda drifting through an unhappy marriage like the one in \"The Pina Colada Song.\" By the way, this clip is amazing.\n\nGame 5 of the World Series is that night. In other words, this will either be ...\nA. One of the greatest days in Kansas City sports history\n\nB. One of the worst days in Kansas City sports history\n... with no in-between.\nIm leaning toward \"one of the worst.\" Hope Im wrong. Sincerely, The Guy Who Has The Royals At 18-1 To Win The World Series right now. Speaking of sneaky-good bets, heres the rest of the Sneaky-Good Watch for Week 8: Todd Bowles, Dan Bailey field goals, Phillys special teams, Austin Davis (!!!), Odell Beckham Jr., every Antone Smith screen pass, every Jim Caldwell sideline shot, Detroits front seven, every LeVeon Bell run, Miamis front seven, the Golden Tate signing (gulp), Ryan Tannehill, the thought of Sammy Watkins with a great QB, Steve Smith since he added the \"Sr.,\" the conspiracy theory that Dallas is running DeMarco Murray into the ground because hes a free agent in four months.\n\nQuestion: Would you rather wager against J.J. Watt when hes gleefully chasing around a rookie QB on a team missing its left tackle, or would you rather wager on Ryan Pickspatrick playing on the road? Is this what Russian roulette feels like? Meanwhile, something important happened when I was away ...\nBS: I did none of those things. I obeyed Rule No. 25 of the Sports Fan Karma Rules: \"Thou shalt not celebrate the injury of anyone on any other team for karmic reasons ... not even if this man single-handedly murdered three of your football seasons.\"\n\nIs it too late to send this game to London? More emails ...\nBS: Outstanding. By the way, Teddy Throwsavelt is having his fantasy breakout game this weekend. You watch.\nBS: What about \n, \"BS: If you ever want to fluster a Cowboys fan, ask them if theyd trade DeMarco Murray for Adrian Peterson right now. Wouldnt that be the jerryjonesiest move of all time? And shouldnt jerryjonesiest be a word?\" My column archives are the jerryjonesiest of column archives. I am terrible at this. Dont tell anyone.\n\nJust a ridiculous line. The Seahawks havent looked good since Week 1; theyve been outscored 125-123 in the past six weeks. They just endured consecutive weeks of insane news cycles -- first, the Percy Harvin trade followed by the Lucchino/Werner/Henry-esque smear campaign of Harvin on his way out the door, followed by this weeks super-insane \"report\" (I use the word loosely) of Seahawks players allegedly bitching behind closed doors that \n. And yet ... they were saddled with a brutal early schedule, got Kitchen Sinked by St. Louis last weekend (seriously, the Rams did everything short of trying a Fumblerooski) and have a sweet Panthers/Raiders/Giants stretch coming up. I cant give up on the 2014 Hawks yet.\nBS: Thanks for setting up our Shakeys Pizza Watch for Week 8: the Marc Trestman Era, the Ken Whisenhunt Era, the Mike Smith Era, EJ Manuels mental conditioning coach, the Andy Dalton Era, Seattles special teams, Carolinas front seven, the Browns/Chargers/Vikings/Niners O-lines, Buffalos secondary, every Jerome Boger Game, anyone who trades with Bill Belichick, Green Bays run D, any Detroit kicker, all \"Jason Garrett Will Be The First Coach Fired\" bets (R.I.P.), the Reggie McKenzie Era, New Englands banged-up defense, any under-oath testimony from any sports commissioner.\n\nIf this isnt a Kitchen Sink Game for the Bengals, then I dont know my Kitchen Sink Games anymore. As for Baltimore ...\nBS: Nah ... people are tired of the Ray Rice story. He punched his fiancee out in an elevator and we were all horrified by the video. Nobody wants to watch him play football, so we dont \n care that the NFL may have violated his rights (and the collective bargaining agreement) by suspending him twice for the same offense. We dont care that the Ravens knew about the second video -- according to multiple reports -- and never explained why they handled it the way they did. We dont care that Roger Goodell re-suspended Rice because of \"new evidence\" from the second elevator video, even though Rice told Goodell on June 16 exactly what happened in that elevator and had multiple witnesses in the room with them (including an NFLPA attorney taking copious notes). We dont care that Goodell later claimed that Rices June 16 account was \"ambiguous\" and that the video showed a \"starkly different sequence of events,\" even though Don Van Natta Jr. and Kevin Van Valkenburg reported on September 19 that \"with his wife sitting by his side in a conference room, Rice told Goodell that he hit her and knocked her out, according to four sources.\" (FOUR!) We dont care that the NFL claims it never saw the second video, even though Rice and his team went into that June 16 meeting believing that the NFL had seen it -- which is why he told the truth -- and even though we know a law enforcement official mailed that video to the NFLs director of security. We dont care that the NFL diligently tried to keep Goodell from testifying about this under oath ... \n.\n(Will we care in two weeks, when Goodell testifies under oath ... and we find out if he violated the CBA by re-suspending someone for no real reason, or why the NFL \n this story away? I hope so.)\n\nIm allowing you to throw the Colts and Dolphins into a two-team money line parlay. I am NOT allowing you to tease the Browns. Just dont. Stay away. Meanwhile ...\nBS: Stop it! Gus Bradley is a keeper, Blake Bortles is a keeper, and your owner stole the show in \n. Things are looking up.\nBS: Theres no way Goodell saw that movie -- it was barely in the theaters and went straight to video, which means they sent him the video and he never got it. (Sorry, I had to.)\n\n\nBS: I cannot refute that conspiracy ... or any NFL-related conspiracies, for that matter. But I dont trust Shakyle Falcorton this week. Whatever happens, just remember ... pain heals, chicks dig scars and glory lasts forever.\n\nHeres your \"NOBODY BELIEVES IN US!\" line of the 2014 season. Ill let Dave explain ...\nBS: I MEAN ...\nBS: To be fair, Ive known that about myself for years and years. But I know this much: I love laying less than two in this Cardinals game.\nYoure giving me a red-hot Aaron Rodgers, playing indoors, against the single-worst defense in football according to DVOA? And Im GETTING points??? Here you go, Vegas -- Im giving you a 15-minute loop of the chorus of Joe Espositos \"Youre the Best\" as a thank-you present.\nBS: I can see it now ... Seattle fighting back to grab the top wild-card spot, New Orleans backing into the NFC South title, then the Seahawks laying 8 1/2  points in New Orleans in Round 1 before everything goes to hell. What an excellent call by Jessica! See, NFL -- you havent driven away all your female fans yet. This is great.\n\nHas there ever been a more dangerous \"WE ARE LOOKING SO DAMNED GOOD RIGHT NOW, WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG?!?!?\" Monday-night home game than this one? At the very least, the Cowboys have to sweat this one out, right? Speaking of sweating ...\nBS: Copy-paste that email and forward it to your buddy who loves the Cowboys. One of four things will happen.\n1. No response whatsoever.\n2. Swear words.\n3. Swear words followed by an insult about someone on your favorite team.\n4. The overcompensating \"I know, I know, this is a house of cards right now!\" email in which theyre secretly trying to reverse-jinx the contents of the email immediately.\nBefore we go, I wanted to run two more reader emails because I thought both were important for different reasons, and they also reflected the general sentiments of hundreds and hundreds of readers over these past few weeks. Thanks to everyone who wrote in, whether it was to speak their mind, check in, say a couple of nice words or whatever. It helped a lot. Seriously. Thank you. Anyway ...\nHeres email no. 1:\n\n\nAnd email no. 2:\n\n\nI hope so, too, Laura. Thanks for writing in. See you next week."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/tom-brady-peyton-manning-cheating/", "blog_text": "Did you enjoy the misleading headline we came up with to generate traffic and rig Google results, only its a complete misrepresentation from what I wrote this week? What a farce, right? Well never do that again, right?\nWebsites rarely pulled those shenanigans in 2002, but in 2014, they do it all the time. Things evolve ... and conversely, things devolve. Just look at football. Earlier this century, ESPNs NFL studio show aired a weekly segment called \"\n\" that celebrated every time a player got demolished by a tackle. Earlier this century, NFL fans believed you won Super Bowls with defense and running backs. Earlier this century, an NFL commissioner suspended a player two games for knocking his fiancee out cold in an elevator, then changed the length of that suspension a few weeks later without any new facts and without anyone thinking this was illegal.\nFine, that last example didnt work. The point is -- THINGS CHANGE. So when I receive a mailbag question like this one from RK in Nashville:\n\"How about Collinsworths \n? Heres the amazing thing about Peyton Manning: Hes an ascending player at the age of, what, 38 years old? I have never seen a great player on that level ascending at that age. If this quote doesnt make the mailbag then that tells me your testicles are resting in a glass jar and being guarded somewhere in Bristol.\"\n... part of me wants to defend the immortal Mr. Manning, part of me cringes at the thought of my testicles living in a glass jar, part of me cringes for the security guard in this scenario, and part of me wants me to click over to \n to confirm that, yes, 38-year-old Barry Bonds DID hit a career-high .370 with 46 homers and a 1.381 OPS.\nCris Collinsworth is totally right. Hes also totally wrong.\nPeyton Manning IS getting better at playing regular-season professional football. Check out his pre-2013 career highs for every major passing category versus his numbers in 2013 and 2014 (through seven games):\n 4,700 yards, 49 TDs, 9 INTs, 9.17 YPA, 87.2 QBR,\n 121.1 rating.\n 5,477 yards, 55 TDs, 10 INTs, 8.32 YPA, 82.9 QBR, 115.1 rating.\n 2,134 yards,\n 22 TDs, 3 INTs, 8.47 YPA, 90.1 QBR, 119.0 rating.\nBut Manning is also getting worse at playing football. His post-surgery noodle arm transformed into Greg Maddux The QB -- less velocity, better precision. He paints the plate with every throw. He keeps defying his aging bodys inherent limitations. Its been astounding to watch.\nWe beat every story line into the ground these days, to the point that we cant even see some of them clearly because we spent so much time beating them. Just look at LeBrons \"homecoming,\" relentlessly marketed as a back-to-Cleveland decision when it was really a basketball decision. (Anyone who thinks LeBron was \"coming home\" in his prime to a team that didnt have Kevin Love and/or a chance to win titles immediately is fooling themselves.) In Mannings case, his triumphant return from four neck surgeries was beaten into the ground, but now its glossed over because everyone already knows the story. Hes not the same physically, and it just doesnt matter. At least in the regular season.\nSo why does it SEEM like Peyton Manning is still \"ascending,\" as Collinsworth said? Because the rules kept drifting in his favor, yet another sports topic that was pummeled into the ground and now gets taken for granted. You cant hit QBs high, you cant hit QBs low, you cant hit QBs within 0.25 seconds after theyve released the football, and its unclear whether you can even make a mean face at them. Remember when QBs were injured all the time? Remember when you NEEDED a backup QB? These are better and safer times -- and they should be -- but quarterbacks dont get injured anymore unless its a freak injury (RG3 earlier this season), a freak hit (Romo on Monday night) or an unexpected concussion (which were diagnosing much better these days). You also cant handcheck receivers, touch them after five yards, head-hunt over the middle or hit them when theyre defenseless. Its much, much, much easier to throw and catch the football.\nCheck this out:\n 0 QBs over 300, one over 275, four over 250\n 0 QBs over 300, one over 275, six over 250\n 0 QBs over 300, four over 275, 10 over 250\n 3 QBs over 300, 11 over 275, 15 over 250\n 1 QB over 75, one over 69, eight over 60, 14 over 50\n 1 QB over 75, four over 69, 11 over 60, 15 over 50\n 6 QBs over 75, nine over 69, 16 over 60, 24 over 50\nThe performances of 38-year-old Barry Bonds and so many other baseball stars from that era were \n because, you know, they took performance enhancers. Maybe it didnt totally make sense in the moment. And maybe we were worried someone was going to grow Jay Lenos chin or break out the first ever size-12 baseball cap. But it certainly makes sense after the fact.\nThe recent performances of Manning and Brady (one year younger) have been enhanced in a different way. Passing rules changed so dramatically that it threw everyones numbers out of whack. Imagine figuring out the last eight years of NBA numbers if, in 2006, the league moved the 3-point line to 20 feet, allowed offensive goaltending and made it legal to take three steps after a dribble. (Well, MORE legal.) Thats basically what happened in the NFL. Just look at the best Brady/Manning seasons in three-year quadrants: 1999-2001, 2002-04, 2005-07, 2008-10, 2011-13, then 2014 (eight starts for Brady, seven starts for Manning).\n 4,413 yards, 33-15 TD-INT, 7.73 YPA, 94.7 rating\n\n\n 2,843 yards, 18-12 TD-INT, 6.88 YPA, 86.5 rating\n 4,557 yards, 49-10 TD-INT, 9.17 YPA, 121.1 rating\n\n\n 3,692 yards, 28-14 TD-INT, 7.79 YPA, 92.6 rating\n 4,397 yards, 31-9 TD-INT, 7.89 YPA, 101.0 rating, 87.2 QBR\n\n\n 4,806 yards, 50-8 TD-INT, 8.32 YPA, 117.2 rating, 87.1 QBR\n 4,500 yards, 33-16 TD-INT, 7.88 YPA, 99.9 rating, 82.8 QBR\n\n\n 3,900 yards, 36-4 TD-INT, 7.93 YPA, 111.0 rating, 77.0 QBR\n 5,477 yards, 55-10 TD-INT, 8.31 YPA, 115.1 rating, 82.9 QBR\n\n\n 5,235 yards, 39-12 TD-INT, 8.57 YPA, 105.6 rating, 73.0 QBR\n 2,134 yards, 22-3 TD-INT, 8.47 YPA, 119.0 rating, 90.1 QBR\n\n\n 2,059 yards, 18-2 TD-INT, 7.33 YPA, 104.7 rating, 75.4 QBR\nInstead of PEDs, they were injecting QB-friendly rules into their bodies. And it has reinvented a rivalry that ...\nA. Would have gone down as the NFLs Russell-Chamberlain battle even if Manning retired in 2011.\nB. Has seen both players grab the invisible \"lead\" multiple times.\nC. Means infinitely more to fans and media members then it does to either of them. (\n)\nIts hard to imagine Manning squandering pole position at this point; his recent Denver resurgence coupled with his touchdown records -- season and career, his MVP awards (five), his win-loss record (173-74) and the career passing yard record (its coming) make him the most successful QB ever by any calculation. But only 30 months ago, when Mannings career hung in the balance during the spring of 2012, \n owned the Manning/Brady championship belt. He had just appeared in his fifth Super Bowl, thrown for over 6,000 yards (including playoffs) and sat on a career record of 124-35 (regular season), 16-6 (playoffs), one 16-0 season and three Lombardis.\nAnd in my opinion, he could have kept the belt had he been wired just a little differently.\n(WARNING! One of my ridiculous theories is coming.)\n(Repeat: Its just a theory. Brace yourself.)\nGrowing up, Manning was the son of a famous QB, the overachieving middle brother, the eventual golden boy, someone who always had something to prove. Ever seen three little brothers hanging out together? Theyre fighting and competing all the time. It never ends. Its a constant battle for the upper hand. Eventually, one of them wins it. That was Peyton. He spent his childhood ordering Eli around, and he spent his football career ordering everyone else around. Remember when he whipped out watermelon-size balls by shockingly signing with Tennessee over Ole Miss (his fathers alma mater)? That set the tone for everything that followed: Peyton wanted the best possible situation at all times. It cant be a coincidence that, for the vast majority of his 16-year career, hes been flanked by legitimate weapons. Manning would never be happy playing for a team that didnt allow him real input -- not just the weapons on hand, but the offensive scheme itself.\nAnd by all accounts, everyone loves working with him. Hes a great teammate. But hes also in charge. All the time. That was Wes Welkers biggest takeaway after playing with Brady and Manning. He told friends that while both players were incredible -- for many of the same reasons (work ethic, competitiveness, likability, etc.) -- he couldnt believe how \n Manning is. In New England, Bill Belichicks fingerprints were everywhere; Brady had significant input, but still, he worked for Belichick (and not vice versa). In Denver, Mannings fingerprints are everywhere. He tells the front office what he needs/wants; he tells the offensive coordinator what system he wants to run; he runs meetings; he orders people around in the locker room; he does everything. Welker, who always bristled at Belichicks authoritarian nature, wondered if the Patriots would be better off had Brady been given that same leadership leash.\nThen again, you have to \n for that level of input. And Brady grew up differently than Manning ... as the baby brother of three older sisters.\nRepeat: THREE OLDER SISTERS.\nI have two children -- a 9 1/2 -year-old daughter and a son who turns 7 this weekend. My daughter OWNS my son. They might be best friends, but they do what she wants to do 95 percent of the time. She orders him around like theyve been married for 30 years. And its not just my house -- I am still waiting to meet the family with the older daughter or daughters whose youngest son runs the show. Doesnt make the son less competitive. Doesnt mean he has a greater chance of failing as an athlete. Just means that, fundamentally, he spent the majority of his time agreeing, nodding and following. If youre a little boy with an older sister, she owns your ass.\n(See? I told you this was one of my most ludicrous theories! I swear, I believe in this one 100 percent.)\nBut THREE older sisters who also happened to be terrific at sports? According to a 2012 Yahoo.com piece called \n Brady remembers, \"They were the best athletes in my house -- certainly a better athlete than I ever was. I just loved tagging along and I was living and dying with every loss they had.\"\nRead that Yahoo piece and you come away thinking, \n But could you say that Brady, for 15 seasons and counting in New England, is still tagging along to some degree? If you believe Belichick and Bob Kraft took the Brady era for granted -- especially these last few years -- you wouldnt be wrong. Because they did. Especially the last third of Bradys career. (Well get to this later.) But if you believe that, you also have to believe that Brady allowed it to happen.\nHis best quality? He puts the team ahead of himself at all times.\nHis worst quality? He puts the team ahead of himself at all times.\nLike every other Boston fan, I always wondered why Brady wouldnt rebel publicly every time the Patriots screwed him over with his \"weapons.\" He won his first Super Bowl throwing to Troy Brown (superb that season), David Patten and Jermaine Wiggins. In 2003 and 2004, he won two more Super Bowls without any Patriots receiver catching 60 passes or tallying more than 900 yards in either season. From a career standpoint, its the worst thing that ever happened to Brady. It made Belichick believe, for better and worse, that the 53-man roster mattered more than riding a once-in-a-lifetime QB. If Brady could win three Super Bowls without any dangerous weapons, then that could keep happening ... right?\nBut heres where Belichick -- one of the great football coaches ever, and the best Boston coach of my lifetime -- kinda sorta maybe screwed up. The Patriots traded Deion Branch for a first-round pick in 2006, leaving Reche Caldwell (760 yards), Ben Watson (643 yards), Troy Brown (384 yards) and Kevin Faulk (356 yards) as Bradys top four receivers.\n The 06 Patriots blew an 18-point lead in the AFC title game and failed to convert a game-clinching third-and-4 because, again, Bradys top targets were Caldwell, Watson, Faulk and a washed-up Troy Brown. So theres one Super Bowl they absolutely gave away.\n Belichick atoned with an uncharacteristically brazen Welker/Randy Moss/Donte Stallworth/Sammy Morris transaction spree, the only time New England ever definitively said, \"WE HAVE TOM BRADY ON OUR TEAM AND WE ARE TAKING ABSOLUTE ADVANTAGE OF THIS!\"\nAlso not helping: From 2003 through 2009, Belichick whiffed every time he spent a high draft pick on a \"weapon,\" whether it was Bethel Johnson, Ben Watson, Chad Jackson, Laurence Maroney, David Thomas, Brandon Tate or OhmygodIwanttoslammyheadagainstthewall.\n Everything flipped in 2010 (the Gronk/Hernandez draft), although the Patriots blew that February 2012 Super Bowl partly because Gronkowski was hobbled and Belichick never splurged on a reliable second receiver. I have two enduring images from that game: Welker sliding into open territory for a game-clinching TD and Brady overthrowing him by a hair (I cant unsee it), and Chad Ochocincos carcass spread wide for the entire second half, covered by a single cornerback and thats it, as the Giants willfully ignored him (I cant unsee that, either).\nThe bizarre set of circumstances from 2013 (the Amendola-for-Welker switcheroo, Gronks body breaking down twice, Hernandez going to jail) left Brady effectively weaponless again, even after he signed for less money under the assumption theyd spend the extra money on help. (Think again, Tom Brady!) Last spring, the Patriots saddled him with another bullpen-by-committee of \"weapons\" that, except for Gronk If Hes Healthy, you wouldnt start in your fantasy league unless your better players were on a bye.\nThats where we are right now. And so its difficult to compare Bradys career and Mannings career for two reasons that even the worlds biggest Manning fan would concede. First, Manning spent his first 12 seasons playing every home game indoors. (I was too lazy to look this up, but Id bet anything that Manning played at least 100 more dome games than Brady during their careers, and Brady played at least 60-65 more cold-weather games than Manning did.) And second, Manning was blessed with better weapons from 2001 through 2006 (it wasnt close), then it swung Bradys way in 2007 (16-0) and 2008 (Brady played less than eight minutes), then it was probably a draw from 2009 through 2011, then Manning grabbed the upper hand again in 2012 and blew Bradys weapons out of the water in 2013 and 2014.\nOf course, you could argue that New Englands teams (three Lombardis, five Super Bowls, eight AFC title games) performed better than Mannings teams (one Lombardi, three Super Bowls, four AFC title games) because, in the salary-cap era, Belichick favored roster balance over roster imbalance. In Mannings last few Colts seasons, especially, Indys commitment to offense ended up hurting it everywhere else. Theres a middle ground that the Patriots successfully exploited for Bradys entire run. But they never stacked the deck, either. Even the Moss/Welker bonanza only happened because Belichick decisively won the trades, giving up a second- and seventh-rounder for Welker and a measly fourth-rounder for Moss. He operates the Patriots like someone scouring a flea market for the best possible deals. Rarely, if ever, will Belichick pay full price for a free agent or trade up for an impact rookie. And thats just how it is.\nRemember when New England barely beat the pathetic Jets two Thursdays ago? Afterward, Brady gave a secretly fascinating interview to the overcrowded NFL Network postgame show. Any die-hard Pats fan has learned to dissect the subtleties of Bradyspeak; he never says anything controversial, never complains about his owner, never makes any teammate or coach look bad or says anything glaringly negative. Hes less Franchise Player and more Kid Who Just Happens To Be Tagging Along. Thats just his DNA.\nBut when something genuinely bothers him? In the right interview, he might passive-aggressively bring up something in the vague vicinity of the real problem, allowing any media member to run with it ... only he does it so subtly, most of them miss his cues. In that post-Jets interview, multiple times, he said things like \n, or \n, or \n and \n (Sadly, its not on the Internet, so Im writing this from memory.) But as a 14-year BradySpeak student, I could tell he was BEGGING them to ask one specific question ...\n\"Tom, how frustrating is it for you to start over every single year?\"\nBecause thats what the Patriots have done to him, year after year, with no sign of it ever changing. He took less money with his last contract -- presumably so they could find him more help -- and yet theyre something like $9 million under the cap (with five or six new offensive starters, depending on the game). He never \n says anything, and he never, ever, ever, ever complains. Shit, he wouldnt have even answered that aforementioned question had they taken the bait. Brady would have done the whole, \n and babbled that answer away.\nBut getting the question asked -- thats what he wanted. He just wanted it out there.\nHe would never say ANY of that. For a lot of reasons -- hes a good guy, hes a great teammate, he doesnt want to undermine the team in any way, he wants everyone around him to think that theyre better than everyone else, and also, hes the youngest brother of three sisters and hes just tagging along.\nMeanwhile, the Broncos lost Eric Decker in free agency last spring. What happened? They went out and signed Emmanuel Sanders. Hes been fantastic. Why spend on Sanders with the Thomases (Julius and Demaryius) coming up for massive extensions? Two reasons ...\n Denvers window with Manning could end anytime. Like, tomorrow. Like, five minutes from now. Who knows? Hes 38. Hes coming off four neck surgeries. Coming into this season, he had played 240 regular-season games and 23 playoff games. Theres no real track record for a QB succeeding in his forties. The Broncos were thinking \"Super Bowl or Bust\" in 2014, and theyll think that way in 2015, and in 2016, and for however long they can drag All-Pro seasons out of Manning. When Sanders wanted $18 million for three years ($6 million guaranteed) to spurn a sitting offer from Kansas City, they didnt blink.\n Because Peyton Manning -- at age fucking 38, after four neck surgeries, with Father Time eyeballing him 24/7 -- wasnt going to accept replacing Decker with someone who wasnt a sure thing.\nSo the Broncos signed Sanders, while the Patriots landed Brandon LaFell for exactly half the money: three years, $9 million, $3 million guaranteed. Thats a classic Belichick move -- always do whats best for your cap and your future, no matter what -- and if Brady hadnt kept rolling over publicly like he had these past 10 years, maybe hed have Sanders\n instead of LaFell right now (yes, I am fully aware that LaFell has looked terrific lately). Maybe he would have had Deion Branch for that third-and-4 in Indy in 2006. Maybe he would have been looking at Anyone But Chad Ochocinco during Super Bowl XLVI. Maybe he wouldnt have completed 105 passes to a seventh-round draft pick/punt returner last season. Maybe he would have won five Super Bowls instead of three. Maybe wed be thinking differently about Brady and Manning right now.\nIts weird to complain about a Belichick-Brady regime thats been so absurdly successful. The Patriots have won 12 games or more in eight of the last 11 seasons, never dipping below 10 wins (which seems impossible, but its true). Theyre 85-15 at home (regular season) since Gillette Stadium was built. Since 2003, theyve won the AFC East every year Brady was the starter, and theyve lost 20 percent as many playoff games (eight) as regular-season games (40). And Brady has started 199 games ... and won 77 percent of them.\nTheyre built to finish 12-4, year after year after year, no matter whos on the team. I would not trade teams for anyone else in the league. Its been an honor and a privilege to follow the New England Patriots. A blessing, even.\nAnd with that said ... I cant believe how strangely theyve handled the final trimester of Bradys career. Odds are, we (and Im using \"we\" because I have loved this team since I was 4 years old and Randy Vataha and Mack Herron were scurrying around, so if you have a problem with that, I dont care) will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, EVER have another quarterback like this again. Hes also 37. With 201 regular-season games, 26 playoff games and one reconstructive knee surgery under his belt.\nAnd I get it. I get that Belichicks philosophy looks something like this ...\n Never stack the deck for any one season.\n Never become too attached to a player.\n Always flip an asset into a better asset.\n Always sell high.\n Build your 53.\n Try to win 11 to 13 games year after year after year.\nHes never bottoming out. Hes never enduring one of those 2011 Colts seasons, where everything collapses just because of one injury. Of all the achievements that make him most proud, Id bet winning 11 games with Matt Freaking Cassel ranks right up there. Belichick lost one of the best quarterbacks of all time, in his prime, not even nine minutes into Week 1. AND HE STILL WON 11 GAMES.\nBelichick knows the NFL playoffs are a total crapshoot. He probably did the math and figured out that eight teams can win the Super Bowl every year; he just wants to be one of the eight. It worked in 2001, 2003 and 2004. It almost worked in 2007 and 2011. Its simple math, and it makes total sense.\nBut he also employed one of the best five or six quarterbacks ever. In a 32-team league, the odds are stacked against stumbling into someone this good even once. It might happen once a century if youre lucky. Like a freaking comet or something.\n The majority of NFL teams have never employed a QB even 75 percent as good as Tom Brady. Could Belichick have risked his time-proven philosophy by bending, say, 20 percent more these last few years? Would we not be discussing this if Hernandez hadnt been arrested, or Belichick had just taken Keenan Allen instead of Aaron Dobson, or any of the other hit-or-miss stuff that fairly and unfairly defines an NFL team?\nHeres what I know: When Rob Gronkowski is healthy and doing Gronk things, Bradys offense goes to another level. These past four games (with healthy Gronk): 158 points, 13 passing TDs for Brady. Gronk played six healthy games in 2013 (197 points), 10 healthy games in 2012 (358 points) and all 16 in 2011 (513 points). Other than 2007 Moss, hes the best weapon Brady has ever had. As long as hes 100 percent, or close, the Patriots have a chance against anyone. And if hes not 100 percent or close, theyre screwed.\nThats the bed that Tom Brady made for himself. Peyton Mannings bed has more weapons in it. Its not a coincidence. Barring another unexpected flip-flop, thats why history will remember Manning as being \"greater\" than Brady -- one guy rolled with the punches, the other guy dictated those punches.\nOf course, they could keep playing and playing and playing, maybe even for the rest of this decade, if only because of the rules. I met Manning at the 2014 ESPYS, talked to him and his wife for a few minutes and eventually asked him about that.\nThe short answer: He didnt know. Manning believed the rules had swung unquestionably in his favor, that quarterbacks just didnt take the same punishment anymore. He specifically mentioned not having to worry about anyone diving at his knees, what a relief that was. But he worried about his health and any unexpected bad luck, ultimately playing the you-never-know card and making a point to mention his four neck surgeries. He also mentioned the grind of just getting ready to play -- the day-after-day demands of the offseason -- and how thats the most underrated factor that normal people dont realize. When that day-to-day fire started waning, thats when he would know.\nDirk Nowitzki mentioned that same stay-or-go reason on one of my podcasts once. And Steve Nash, too. Its the one thing great players always want us to know -- at some point, the physical and mental grind of \n to play surpasses everything else. We only see the games. We dont see 6 a.m. every day, day after day after day, when the alarm clock goes off and they have to keep chasing something theyve already caught. I spent maybe eight minutes with Manning, but my takeaway was that as soon as that alarm clock goes off and hes lying in bed, with his body aching, with all of these records already in hand, wondering why its even worth it -- thats when Peyton Manning will quit football.\nTom Brady? Now thats a slightly different story. He has played 43 fewer games than Manning.\n Hes one year younger. By all accounts, he lives and breathes football and thats it. Doesnt have any other hobbies or vices. Goes to sleep early every night. Cant really think of anything else he even wants to do other than spend time with his family. One night earlier this year, I ran into friends in New York who happened to be with Julian Edelman. After a breakout season, Edelman had been debating whether to re-sign or leave for a bigger offer ... which meant hed be leaving Tom Brady. And his friends were busting his balls about it. \n It was actually pretty funny.\nEdelman knew what I did for a living. He had a couple of drinks in him. He was feeling emotional about Brady -- again, it was unclear whether they were done as teammates -- and launched into an endearingly genuine monologue about Bradys brilliance. What an unbelievable teammate Brady was. What an unbelievable quarterback he was. How he worked harder, day in and day out, than any teammate Edelman had ever had. How he owed everything to the guy. We joked that Edelman almost sounded like a religious fanatic discussing the Cult of Brady or something. But thats how he felt.\nI asked him how long Brady could keep playing, and without hesitation, Edelman said, \"As long as he wants.\"\n\"Like, 43?\"\nEdelman nodded. He described Brady as a \"football machine,\" adding, \"Hes in bed by eight thirty every night!\" He had never seen anything like Tom Brady. He couldnt imagine Brady NOT playing football. Six more years, at least. Thats what he believed.\n(And yes, Edelman re-signed with the Patriots just a few weeks later. Lets just say I wasnt surprised.)\nIf Brady played into his early forties, that would mean he was cheating -- and by \"cheating,\" I mean \"cheating Father Time.\" Could a quarterback really play at an All-Pro level at 40 and beyond? Seems insane. Absolutely insane.\nBut with the current rules, why not? Why couldnt Manning AND Brady knock down that 40-and-over door?\nYou cant rule it out. And because of that, you cant yet say that Manning officially prevailed in the Brady-versus-Manning rivalry. We know were in the later rounds ... we just dont know if its the 12th, 13th, 14th or 15th. Yeah, Manning leads on every scorecard. For now. Just make sure you dont count out the little brother with three sisters yet.\n(And by the way -- Im picking the Pats on Sunday. 38-37. May the rivalry never end.)"}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/revisiting-the-y2k-compliant-quarterbacks/", "blog_text": "Nearly 15 years later, I remember three things about Y2K. First, many people were legitimately concerned that computers would freak out at midnight, all hell would break loose, and wed land in a real-life version of \n crossed with \n ... even though we didnt know what either of these things were in 1999.\n It was secretly disappointing when midnight came and went without an electronic catastrophe. Like so many others, I wanted to know what it would be like to live without electricity, loot grocery stores and murder others to survive. Maybe someday.\nSecond, the Y2K hype spawned one of wrestlings greatest entrances -- Chris Jerichos \"Y2J\" gimmick, which claimed first place in \n that you probably blocked out of your mind.\nAnd third, I remember thinking about the end of the world and being bummed out about one thing and one thing only: not that Id be losing the chance to have kids or get married, not that Id be losing my dream of building a big audience for my \"Sports Guy\" column, not that Id be losing the last two-thirds of my life ... but that Id live and die without seeing a Boston team win a World Series or a Super Bowl.\nSo yeah, Y2K feels like it happened roughly 70 years ago. And now, were starting to slap the makings of a century together. Were 14 years in. The words \"21st century\" actually mean something. And in the 21st century, exactly 10 quarterbacks have won Super Bowls.\n* Tom Brady (five times)\n\n* Ben Roethlisberger (twice)\n\n* Kurt Warner\n\n* Trent Dilfer\n\n* Brad Johnson\n\n* Peyton Manning\n\n* Drew Brees\n\n* Aaron Rodgers\n\n* Joe Flacco\n\n* Russell Wilson\nFine, fine. You caught me. ELEVEN quarterbacks have won a Super Bowl in the 21st century.\n* Tom Brady (three times)\n\n* Ben Roethlisberger (twice)\n\n* Eli Manning (twice)\n\n* Kurt Warner\n\n* Trent Dilfer\n\n* Brad Johnson\n\n* Peyton Manning\n\n* Drew Brees\n\n* Aaron Rodgers\n\n* Joe Flacco\n\n* Russell Wilson\nSo what jumps out about that list? You know, other than the fact that Eli Manning won two f- - - ing Super Bowls? Lets see ...\n* The weakest QBs? Trent Dilfer and Brad Johnson definitely \"game managed\" their way to titles,\n which happened occasionally until the NFL changed its pass-defense rules \n. Did you know that Baltimore won four straight playoff games with Dilfer completing 35 passes ... total? And Johnson played for four teams, started all 16 games just three times and threw for 691 career yards fewer than Jon Kitna. But give him Jon Grudens offense and Tampa Bays loaded 2002 defense and what happened? BRAD JOHNSON COULD MANAGE THE GAME!\n Every time a Chiefs fan says, \"I think we can win the Super Bowl with Alex Smith,\" theyre really saying, \"I mean, the 2002 Bucs won a Super Bowl with Brad Johnson!\" I dont know. Those were different times.\n* The third-weakest QB on that list? Eli Manning. Im the wrong person to shepherd a \"Could the 2007 Giants and 2011 Giants have won Super Bowls with any decent QB?\" conversation, if only because I might intentionally injure myself. So lets just agree that the Giants scored 38 points combined in those two Super Bowls, one of which went New Yorks way because their 17th-string receiver caught the last pass of his career with his helmet.\n* Its too early to have an opinion on Russell Wilsons Super Bowl, but the \"Luck or Wilson?\" debate finished filming in October. (Spoiler alert: Luck won.) Is Wilson an infinitely more athletic Brad Johnson? Is his 2014 performance suffering because his offensive line collapsed and he doesnt have enough weapons (and not because we overrated him)? Or, could you say hes where Brady was in 2002 -- one year away from jumping a level, and three years away from jumping two levels, and five years away from finishing the video game? To be continued.\n* Im happy that Warner won a Super Bowl because, for a few years at least, he was every bit as frightening as Marino, Favre, Montana and every other great QB. He also triggered the remarkably effective \"never bet against God, puppies or gambling theories hatched in Pakistan\" rule (\n). He belongs.\n* For four straight postseason games in 2013, Flacco had an out-of-body experience: 1,140 yards, 11 TDs, 0 picks, 9.05 YPA, 117.2 rating and one of the great season-saving miracle throws ever (the Jacoby Jones-Rahim Moore pseudo-Hail Mary). \n, trailing only 1989 Joe Montana and finishing 745 spots ahead of 1985 Tony Eason. Were those four Flacco weeks the football equivalent of, say, Nic Cage randomly crushing \n and winning an Oscar, then immediately reverting back to being Nic Cage? Absolutely. But you can never take away those four Flacco weeks, and you can never take away Nic Cages Oscar.\n(Well, at least not yet.)\n(Then again ... )\n(Actually, its probably a good idea to take away Nic Cages Oscar. But Joe Flacco, were letting you keep those four weeks.)\n* The five best QBs of the 21st century, by any calculation, are Brady, Brees, Rodgers, Roethlisberger and Peyton Manning in some order. Well, every Super Bowl from the one with Janet Jacksons nipple until the one with the still-mysterious, momentum-turning Superdome blackout involved one of those five guys. Theyve captured eight combined Lombardis and made 13 Super Bowl appearances in all.\nWhy bring up that Y2K list? For one thing, if you forced me into a 21st Century QB Mount Rushmore decision, I would bump Brees before Roethlisberger. Brees has six career playoff wins, one Super Bowl win and one conference title game appearance. He spent his entire career playing home games in 75-degree weather (San Diego) or indoors (New Orleans). And the team that drafted him eventually gave up on him. Meanwhile, Roethlisberger joined the NFL three years after Brees -- right now, he has 10 playoff wins, two Super Bowl wins, three Super Bowl appearances, four conference title game appearances and one of the great throw-and-catches in football history (the Super Bowl winner to Santonio Holmes that beat Arizona). He has also spent his entire career outdoors for the same cold-weather team. Its no contest. For regular season -- Brees. For everything -- Roethlisberger.\nHes the most underrated quarterback of the 21st century. Its true.\nCould you argue that the general public doesnt want to place him on that Brady-Rodgers-Manning pedestal because of whatever happened in Lake Tahoe and Georgia? The Tahoe incident was eventually \n, and the \nI believe those incidents affected how many fans regard Roethlisbergers football resume as a whole. \nMeanwhile, Im pretty sure that Roethlisberger hasnt filmed a major commercial since 2009. (I couldnt find one on the Internet, thats for sure.) His national profile effectively consists of 16 to 20 football games per year, dozens of press conferences and the occasional \"insightful\" sitdown with Bob Costas (or whomever) that never reveals anything interesting. And were fine with it. That 2009 incident inspired us to collectively reject the mythology of Roethlisbergers greatness, even though so many went the other way with Kobe Bryant earlier in the decade (in an undeniably similar situation). And that was the case for years and years. Quarterbacks are sacred to us, for whatever reason.\nBut Roethlisbergers recent 12-touchdown barrage, and his phenomenal season in general, propelled him back into that Great QB conversation once and for all. You know when I officially realized this? After I read this email from Kurt Hetrick in San Diego:\n\"Your final Week 9 pick (Colts over Giants) came with the explanation, Im not betting against great QBs in night games anymore unless theyre going against another great QB. (Sorry, Eli.)\" Meanwhile ONE PICK EARLIER you took the Ravens over the Steelers who PLAYED IN A NIGHT GAME, and just one week after Roethlisberger threw for six touchdown passes ... which was also what he did this week. Hes been to three Super Bowls, won two and is one of four quarterbacks to win 100 games in his first 150 starts (joining Bradshaw, Montana, and Brady). Hes the only QB with two 500 yard games, one of only two quarterbacks (YA Tittle is the other) with two 6-TD games in a season, and now has 22 TDs and 3 picks. Even Sammy Jankis wouldnt have forgotten something in the time period it took to type those two picks. Ill be waiting for your Zack Mettenberger Titans pick in that Monday Nighter in two weeks.\"\nIn the words of Dave Dameshek quoting Jerry Orbach from \n, when Im wrong, Im wrong. Roethlisberger IS great. Of any quarterback that Ive ever gambled against or rooted against, Big Ben remains the most terrifying in one specific situation: \n Even if he doesnt routinely throw up video-game numbers, youd feel 100 percent comfortable riding him for any big game or any season-saving drive. Thats a short list ... and hes definitely on it. Ben Roethlisberger plays quarterback better than just about anybody.\nBack to the Y2K/Super Bowl thing: I brought it up because theres another list of memorable 21st-century QBs who \n won a Super Bowl. Heres that list ...\n* Rich Gannon\n\n* Steve McNair\n\n* Donovan McNabb\n\n* Jake Delhomme\n\n* Carson Palmer\n\n* Philip Rivers\n\n* Tony Romo\n\n* Matt Ryan\n\n* Colin Kaepernick\n\n* Andrew Luck\nGannon and McNair came damned close to pulling their own Brad Johnson moments. McNabbs Eagles teams revolved around him, for better and worse, only he was never quite good enough. Delhommes topsy-turvy career peaked with 2003s improbable hot streak -- two playoff upsets, then Delhomme scaring the bejesus out of every overconfident Patriots fan during the Nipple Bowl. (Can we start calling it that, please?) You could have \n won the Super Bowl with all four guys; it just never happened.\nAs for the non-retired guys, Romo is Romo -- the most polarizing QB of this century not named Michael Vick. But he could have made a Super Bowl on the right team. Same for Rivers, whos really a better version of Romo with more kids. Ryan \n, although he didnt -- so maybe that says something, too. Kaepernick came within one botched first-and-goal series of fending off Ray Lewiss deer antler spray and winning the Super Bowl. And Luck, of anyone on that list, is the surest wager to win at least one Lombardi. Maybe sooner than we think.\nFor everyone on that list -- you need luck, timing, coaching and a killer support system just to sniff the Super Bowl, much less win it. Which brings us to Carson Palmer, who becomes The Most Underrated QB Of The 21st Century as soon as we stop underrating Roethlisberger. You might remember me making fun of Palmer in this column many, many, many times. Many times. Many, MANY times. And I stand by all of it.\n[\n The Cardinals must think Palmer is underrated, too; tonight the team announced that it gave him a \n.]\nStill, no 21st-century QB had worse luck than Carson Palmer did. \n less than 13 months ago on Grantland, so I wont rehash it here. But I love playing the \"What if?\" game with certain never-quite-got-there NBA stars (Chris Webber, Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, etc.) thats framed around a specific question:\nIf you were blessed with a \"Reset\" button and the ability to play an athletes career 10 times, would the real-life outcome be the unluckiest career of those 10 times?\nFor instance, if you replayed Webbers career 10 times, he goes down as one of the NBAs 30 greatest players ever at least seven or eight of those times. Only three things could derail someone that talented: a major injury (happened), circumstances (happened) and bad luck (happened). If Orlando never traded Webbers rights for Penny Hardaways rights and three first-round picks, he and Shaq would have destroyed everybody. (Thats bad luck.) If Webber hadnt entered the NBA during the height of the Too Much Too Soon era, he wouldnt have used his contract leverage to bully his way from a loaded Warriors team to a mediocre Washington team. (Thats circumstances -- you never want to give a 21-year-old that kind of power, but thats what the NBA was doing in the mid-90s.) And if he never ruined his knee, Webbers prime would have lasted twice as long. (The injury card, obviously.) So it took THREE different flukes to prevent Webbers career from being as good as or better than Kevin Garnett.\nNow, Carson Palmer wasnt as sure of a thing as C-Webb. On the list of franchise QBs drafted first overall, his chances for a kick-ass Hall of Fame career were below Peyton and Luck, ahead of Tim Couch and David Carr, and probably dead even with Eli and Stafford. But one thing after another happened to him: The cheap-ass Bengals drafted him, then he blew out his knee on his first playoff pass during 2005s breakout season, then he injured his throwing elbow in 2008, then he got traded to Siberia (the Raiders), then he landed in Arizona as the teams 345th attempt to replace Kurt Warner with anyone competent.\nWhen Barnwell posted his \"Cant-Miss Kid\" article on October 18, 2013, it read like something of a football obituary. And rightly so.\nSo what happened?\nDid Palmer read the article and go into Rocky-in-Russia mode?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q57qB6Kwroo?\nDid we underestimate Barnwells reverse powers?\nWas this the all-time coincidence in the history of Grantland coincidences?\nWe only know that Palmer -- within a few days of Barnwells column -- suddenly transformed back into Someone You Might Be Able To Win A Super Bowl With. Hes won 12 of his last 14 starts, losing the other two by three points apiece. \n, he ranks sixth in QBR during that stretch (69.8, trailing only Peyton Manning, Rodgers, Rivers, Brady and Brees), and he has thrown for 3,918 yards and 27 TDs with just 11 picks.\nIts the uncarsonpalmeriest Carson Palmer stretch in nearly a decade. Some of the reasons make sense -- hes been blessed with a killer home-field advantage (The Nest!), an excellent defense (sixth in DVOA), an explosive runner (Andre Ellington), three dangerous receivers (including the dramatic return of Fitz!), and what has probably been the leagues best coaching staff (seriously, should we convince Bruce Arians to run for president in 2016?). But you know what doesnt make sense? That Carson Palmer looks like hes having one of those 2008 Warner moments. You know, the washed-up guy whos suddenly killing it again.\nAnd hes coming through in big moments, too. Whats the Throw of the Year right now? Palmers ballsy, game-saving third-down bomb to John Brown against Philly. Look at this baby.\nThis isnt one of those Josh McCown five-game rope-a-dope situations. Palmer has been playing extremely well for 13 solid months, even persevering when his receivers caught a recent case of the dropsies (\n). Heres how President-Elect Arians \n this week.\n\"Swagger is a true belief. I think guys that talk a lot sometimes are trying to talk themselves into it. You watch for that. But our guys, I dont see any cockiness in our football team. I see a true belief that were going to win every week. And our quarterback is Carson Palmer! Can you f- - - - - g believe this????\"\nFine, I made the last two sentences up. But the Cardinals have some subtle omens going against them. Theyre 16th in overall DVOA; they have a Pythagorean record thats two wins lower than their real record (\n);\n and theyve recovered nine of 14 fumbles (third-luckiest in the league) and theyre plus-10 in turnover differential. Any numbers nerd is waving a \"REGRESSION!!!!!\" flag right now.\nThey were also stripped of \"Nobody Believes In Us!\" status after that Philly win; its never good when its Week 10 and people are writing articles like \"\n\" and \"\n\" and even \"\n.\" Does that mean Arizona should consider throwing this weeks Rams game to be safe? Of course not. But the \"Everybody Believes In Us\" factor unnerves me.\nOh, and if I had told you 13 months ago that Carson Palmer would be leading a 2014 title contender, you would have asked which CFL team had signed him. Theres that, too.\nFlipping it around, the 2014 Cardinals are loaded with compelling stories that everyone would beat into the ground during Super Bowl week. Palmer and the Juvenation Machine. Larry Fitz and Larry Fitzs pop (the sequel!). The Honey Badger. The whole \"hosting your own Super Bowl\" thing, as well as the \"How bout the dominant NFC West?\" thing. Bruce Arians nearly retiring after the 2011 season when Pittsburgh didnt renew his coordinator contract, then belatedly emerging as a top-five coach. #ChuckStrong showing up to support Arians and saying #ChuckStrong things. Todd Bowles being The Next Great High-Demand Coaching Candidate. \n to his late brother. The missing stars (John Abraham, Darnell Dockett and Daryl Washington) cheering their dudes on. Patrick Petersons inevitable \"We need to appreciate that this is one of THE best players in football\" story arc. Kurt Warner giving 290 interviews about how close they came in 2009.\nIt goes on and on and on. You can SEE them in the Super Bowl. But I believe in the Cardinals simply because they remind me of the 2003 Patriots, an exceptionally well-coached team with a knack for pulling out close games. From October 5, 2003, through February 1, 2004 (the Nipple Bowl), the Patriots \n, with 10 coming by eight points or fewer. And look, I love advanced numbers for football. Those numbers tell us, emphatically, that theres a pretty thin line between success and failure in close games, that a 16-game football season is a smaller sample size than we realize, and that your luck eventually reverts back to the norm (one way or the other). I understand and concede these points.\nBut lets also agree that, occasionally, a football team shows up that just seems \n playing close games. For the Cardinals, there are six tangible reasons for this: exceptional coaching, an A-list secondary that shuts down third-and-longs, a superb red zone defense, multiple playmakers who can explode at any time, a running game that can protect tight leads, and a veteran QB whos too old to get scared. (And thats not counting whats become the best home-field advantage in football now that the 12th Man has contracted bandwagonitis.) And yet, Arizonas intangibles are just as impressive. I loved what Brian Billick \n:\n\"The Cardinals are playing loose and with a confidence bordering on arrogance. You dont necessarily want your guys making Super Bowl Shuffle videos, but you do like that authentic sense of self-assurance. As Former Secretary of State Colin Powell put it, Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. I saw it with my Baltimore Ravens the year we marched to the Super Bowl. They went from hoping theyd win games to knowing they were going to win games, and that can make a crucial difference.\"\nSo to recap ...\nBruce Arians: \"Swagger is a true belief ... I see a true belief that were going to win every week.\"\nColin Powell: \"Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.\"\nBrian Billick: \"I saw it with my Baltimore Ravens the year we marched to the Super Bowl.\"\nIm in! Im all in! Sign me up! I dont care if the Cardinals have inadvertently become the \"Everybody Believes In Us\" team -- theyre the NFCs best football team, I believe in their tangibles and intangibles, and I even kinda-sorta-maybe believe in their QB. Besides, in a 21st century thats been as goofy as advertised, it makes perfect sense that Carson Palmer would start a home Super Bowl game ... right? Please manage your gambling wagers accordingly.\nOn to the Week 10 picks ...\n(Home teams in caps)\n\nI \n because the line was three points too high, but also because of Andy Daltons slow-simmering meltdown and these two emails (from last weekend):\n \"Is it too late for the Bengals to redo Daltons deal to pay him based upon the schedule? Hes really good in 1:00 Sunday games at home against teams that are, at best, slightly above average. He could get paid the pro-rated max for those games, then a sliding scale down to prime time games (which he could work pro-bono). As a Bengal fan I would feel better knowing that hes not getting paid for crumbling under the lights. This week would be interesting -- a prime time home game against both the City of Cincinnatis arch-rival and the football gods who seemed determine to have Cleveland stay just good enough that Johnny Football does not see the field. Id say veteran minimum for this one.\"\n \"Do you ever recreate CBS commentary on Andy Dalton in Morgan Freemans voice in your head? I do it all the time, and I might be losing my mind.\n\"In 2014, Andy Dalton escaped from the pocket and threw another pick under pressure. All they found of him was a set of bushy ginger eyebrows, a helmet that looked like the furniture in Hugh Hefners bedroom, and a tired arm, damn near worn down to the nub. I remember thinking it would take a man six hundred years to win a Super Bowl with it. Old Andy let us know he wouldnt do it in less than five. Oh, Andy loved geology. I imagine it appealed to his maladroit nature. A fumble here, million picks there. Geology is the study of pressure and time. Thats all it takes really, pressure, and time. That, and a horrible offensive line. Like I said, in Cincinnati a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied. Turns out Andys favorite hobby was throwin his ball away on the football field, a fanful at a time. I guess after Gio was killed, Andy decided hed been here just about long enough. Andy did like he was told, muffed those plays with a high ginger whine. The coaches simply didnt notice. Neither did I ... I mean, seriously, how often do you really look at a mans hair? Andy crawled to Cleveland through five hundred yards of shit smelling foulness I cant even imagine, or maybe I just dont want to. Five hundred yards ... thats the length of five football fields, just shy of what Roethlisberger throws every week.\n\"Anyway, once you start saying things in your head like Morgan Freeman, you cant stop. Be careful.\"\n(We liked John May from Vermont immediately. Also, how could I lay 6.5 points with the Bengals after those two emails! Is it time for AJ McCarron and Katherine Webb to become the First Couple of Cincinnati? Are we there yet?)\n\nDoes anyone else love that we keep torturing the English by sending them terrible football games? They shouldnt have messed with us in the 1700s -- its their fault. I fully expect the Cowboys to finish 8-8 again, which means theyre blowing this game to Bad News Blake Bortles. My upset special: Jags 24, Cowboys 10.\nBS: Thats a great point -- even if Romo spends the entire flight standing in the aisle and repeatedly telling people, \"I cant sit down, I have two broken bones in my back, holy shit this hurts, I wish someone would dip me in a tub filled with Toradol,\" at least thats better than, \"Tony isnt on this plane.\"\nBS: America is giddy! If they blow this Jags game, theyre suddenly 6-4. From there: bye week, at Giants, home for Philly, at Chicago and Philly, home for Indy, at Washington. Come on, they could blow four of those! Lets do this! We want 8 and 8! We want 8 and 8!\n\nPresented without comment ...\n\n\nBS: You left out, \"Ryan Mallett: You guys arent even giving me a chance?\" By the way, I think we should put a bow on Ryan Fitzpatricks career as a starting QB.\nRecord as a starter: 31-54-1\n\nNumber of NFL teams that started him: 5\n\nNumber of winning seasons: 0\n\nMost wins in one season: 6\n\nCareer: 117 touchdown passes, 101 picks, 28 lost fumbles, 185 sacks, 78.4 rating\nHeres why I brought this up. The internet offers just about everything at this point, right? Why cant I look up the career winning percentages of everyone who ever started an NFL game? I can find a comprehensive (and excellent) breakdown of \n, but I cant find a simple list of the worst QB winning percentages? Has anyone started 85 NFL games and won less than Fitzpatrick? We know Joey Harrington finished 26-50 and David Carr finished 23-56 ... but did anyone win a lower percentage of 85 or more games than Fitzpatricks minus-23?\nFortunately, Grantland has one of the best editorial assistants/competitive eaters in the world: the one and only Danny Chau. Heres what Danny found out: \n since 1920 has won less than Fitzpatrick after starting at least 85 games, a 5-foot-9 quarterback named Eddie \"\n\" LeBaron, who had a 26-52-3 record from 1952 to 1963.\nBS: Glad you brought this up. Right now, the Chargers are 5-4 and coming off three straight losses to a definite Super Bowl contender (Denver), a possible Super Bowl contender (Miami) and a probable 10-win team (Kansas City, a game that could have gone either way). They have a bye week to lick their wounds (and get healthy), then home games against Oakland and St. Louis. Lets say they win those two. After that -- at Baltimore, home for New England, home for Denver, at San Francisco, at Kansas City. And they cant finish worse than 10-6.\nI mean ... even I dont believe in them. And I picked them to be a Super Bowl contender.\n(In other words ... literally, NOBODY BELIEVES IN YOU, SAN DIEGO!!!! Keep an eye on this one.)\n\n\nBS: Hmmmmmm ... I dont know. Lets ask Thom Yorke.\n\nGrabbing the points for four reasons: home dog, Buffalo fans, Sammy Watkins and the undeniable reality that we havent had one of those patented Andy Reid snatching-defeat-from-the-jaws-of-victory games in five solid weeks. Remember, hes good for three a year and weve had only one so far (Week 5, San Francisco). Speaking of Sammy ...\nBS: Come on, you dont need a nickname when your first name is \"Sammy,\" and you definitely dont need a nickname when youre \"Sammy Watkins.\" That name is better than anything a screenwriter could make up. Lets all agree never to call him anything other than Sammy Watkins.\nBut you know what we DO need a nickname for? Anytime Mike Carey awkwardly breaks down any review of one of Jerome Bogers atrocious calls. Its like the streams crossing in \n. Send me the best nickname and Ill run it next week.\n\nGreat game. Like both of these teams. I had the Lions all week but couldnt shake the memory of \nbetween Jim Caldwell and Mike Smith that, frankly, might warrant its own 30 for 30 at this point. \nEyes Wide Shut\n Two of my favorite emails after that game ...\n \"You forgot Gambling Rule #437: Anytime Jim Caldwell coaches in another continent, his team will score zero points in the first half while he wonders where he is. Take the other team.\"\n \"Jim Caldwells weekday coaching deserves a nomination for Sneaky Good Watch status. The Lions commit considerably fewer dumb penalties, turn the ball over less, and are generally a much less stupid football team this year. Under Schwartz facing the kind of adversity they had the last few weeks, they would have fallen apart and been blown out. That said, Jim Caldwells gameday coaching definitely needs to be included in the Shaky Watch this week. He punted on 4th-and-6 from the opponents 37 down 14, kicked a FG from the 2 down 21, kicked another FG from the 4 down 11, decided to settle for a 48 yard FG despite the Lions kicking woes, and most amazingly ran the ball with no timeouts left on third down and 25 seconds left. Which means his plan was to sprint the field goal team onto the field, which almost never works. And to give me an aneurysm.\"\nAnd Im supposed to take Caldwells Lions against a cresting Miami team that might be REALLY good? No thank you. Speaking of Miami ...\nBS: Couldnt agree more. And I try to pick games accordingly. For instance, I felt bad for Philbin and his family, but at some point, you drift into \"I wonder how that will affect the game\" mode. And many times, emotion carries the day with this stuff -- especially in football. But as Michael points out, we need a better system for capturing non-football variables -- definitely a Twitter feed (I dont know what it should be called, but it should exist) for now, but when ESPN launches a gambling channel someday (and why wouldnt we?), thats the kind of stuff I want to see crossing the ticker. The Dolphins love their coach -- they played hard for him last Sunday, and theyre going to play hard for him this Sunday.\n\nI cant believe the Saints have a chance to go from 2-4 to 12-4. Theyre catching the Niners at a perfect time, right when Im getting emails like this ...\n\n\nBS: Come on -- we all know that Harbaugh is out of there after the season. Five months from now, M. Night Harbaughlan is going to be filming \n in New York with Geno Smith. Its coming. I wish we could bet on this.\nBS: Didnt you read what just I wrote? Youre getting M. Night Harbaughlan! Things are looking up! By the way, I think the Jets somehow cover this one. Cant explain it. The line is suspiciously, curiously low for reasons that CANNOT be explained.\nBS: The Cleveland-Pittsburgh rivalry, everybody! Its heating up!\nTwo-Team Teaser alert!\nSound the alarm!!!!!\nTWO-TEAM TEASER ALERT!!!!!! EASY MONEY AHEAD!!!!!!!!!\nIm not watching one minute of this game. And neither should you. The better question: Which fan base is more depressed right now? Normally youd lean toward Atlanta because the Falcons have never won a Super Bowl, but check out this email from Al Jespee:\n\"Which will end up more disappointing: the cream of the 2013 NBA draft or the 2013 NFL quarterback class? Mike Glennon is FAR AND AWAY the best QB of that group. Not only that, but thanks to passing stat inflation, hes on his way to becoming the best quarterback in Buccaneers history! Hes going to finish this season seventh in passing touchdowns. After less than two years! And hes already fifth in career passer rating behind four generic Jon Gruden projects. God this team is depressing. I miss Raheem.\"\nMy verdict: Im grabbing the points while also feeling more empathetic for the Falcons in the Most Depressed NFC South Fan Base battle. One Super Bowl appearance, no Lombardis, the Michael Vick thing, Eugene Robinson, 20 years when I cant remember anyone on their team other than Billy \"White Shoes\" Johnson ... I mean, at least Tampa DID win a Super Bowl, right?\n\nHeres where you say, \"Wait a second, didnt you just pick the Cards to go to the Super Bowl? Is this why your picks suck so much?\" The short answers -- yes and yes. The longer answer: This has all the making of the \"Everyone teases Arizona because theyre a sure thing in the middle of a week of Super Bowl hype, only to freak out when the Rams go up 10-0\" game. I see the Cards clawing back and winning by three or fewer.\nQuickly on the Rams: Theyre the NFL version of me as a golfer. I started playing golf again this year after a self-imposed 20-year hiatus, which is actually a good story that I will tell some other time. In the past six months, Ive played 15 times. My game is slowly coming back. Right now, Im shooting between 95 and 100 from the blues. And every round is the same -- I have four awesome holes and four horrible ones, with a slew of bogeys and double bogeys in between. That makes me a good best-ball partner as long as Im playing with someone good.\nThats the Rams -- youd want them for best ball, but not real life. During a 16-game season, theyre going to bogey or double bogey eight holes, fall apart on four holes and overachieve on four holes. They already birdied Week 7 (the Seattle game) and shot par in Week 9 (the Niners win). In Week 10, I see them crushing a great drive on a par-4, just missing the approach, then three-putting for a frustrating bogey. I swear, this made more sense before I started writing it.\nBS: I think Arizonas stinker game is coming either next week (home for Detroit) or in Seattle (Week 12). Every NFL team plays one crappy game per season. You cant avoid it.\nCheck out this addition to this weeks Shakeys Pizza Watch, Presented by Jim Caldwell: Andy Dalton, Andy Dalton a second time, the Chargers/Niners O-lines, Teddy Bridgewaters deep balls, Denvers special teams, Wes Welker, the Wilson-Kaepernick rivalry, Peyton in bad weather, Cam Newton, Dallass D, Jadeveon Clowneys rookie cards, the 2013 QB draft class, and in all caps ... THE 12TH MAN.\nThats right, Seattle. You know I love your city and you know I hate how OKC stole the Sonics from you. But save for opening night, your crowds have sucked this season. Peyton Manning went 80 yards in like three seconds to force OT on you. You lost to Dallas at home. You couldnt blow out the lowly Raiders last week, for Gods sake. Are you suffering from \n (a.k.a. too many bandwagon fans)? Are you taking this stuff for granted now? Whats up? Youre like the husband who marries his dream girl and immediately stops working out and puts on 25 pounds. Get back on the treadmill. \"The 12th Man\" used to mean something.\nOh, and by the way, Arizona took your \"Best Crowd in the League\" corner. The Cardinals fans just swooped right in and stole it from you. Youre Avon, theyre Marlo. Thats a fact. Do you care? Do you care at all? NOW GO OUT THERE ON SUNDAY AND BE THE CROWD I KNOW YOU CAN BE!\n\n\nBS: The good news ... Jay Cutler is coming to town!\nThat brings us to the Sneaky-Good Watch for Week 10: Jeremy Maclins contract year, Miamis pass D (first in QBR allowed), the ceiling of New Englands pass D, Jerick McKinnon, DeSean Jacksons F.U. season, Brandon Browners 2001 Bryan Cox potential, Jamie Collinss All-Pro potential, Ryan Tannehills athletic ability, \n, Travis Kelces Heath Miller 2.0 potential, and anytime Jay Cutler comes to town.\n\nTwo of Grantlands finest employees are Sean Fennessey and Chris Ryan. They happen to be close friends, they occasionally drive to and from work together, and they can even communicate in staff meetings just by glancing at one another. Fennessey is a long-suffering Jets fan; Ryan is a long-suffering Eagles fan. Once upon a time, Mark Sanchez tortured Fennessey to the point that he thought about quitting football completely. This was rock bottom.\nIn 2014, the Sanchize landed in Philly as Chip Kellys reclamation project. Last week, Nick Foles broke his collarbone and Sanchez saved the day against Houston. He looked good enough that some people (a) picked him up in fantasy football, and (b) wondered if he could have a Plunkett-esque rejuvenation in Philly. And even if Chris Ryan will deny it to the death, deep down, hes talking himself into the parallel \"I mean, Sanchez did play in an AFC title game and beat the Patriots in the playoffs on the road\" and \"If anyone can turn him around, its Chip Kelly\" narratives. Again, hed never admit this. But hes thinking it.\nAnd Fennessey? Hes just sitting there with a big smile on his face, like someone in college with a crazy ex who just found out that his or her good friend might be falling for that crazy ex. \n We all know how this season is going for Jets fans -- theyre going to finish 2-14 or 3-13 and miss out on whatever franchise QB is sitting there by one pick, then theyre going to chase Jim Harbaugh for weeks only to watch him sign somewhere else at the last minute. Theyll end up settling for Jim Schwartz or Gary Kubiak as their head coach because theyre the Jets. But at the very least, they get to root for Mark Sanchez to screw up the 2014 Eagles ... right?\n(Gambling Manifesto Rule No. 72B: When in doubt, always bet against any scenario that might bring joy to Jets fans.)\n "}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-week-of-nfl-reckoning/", "blog_text": "Its Week 11! I love Week 11! Heres what happens in Week 11 ...\n\nGo away, dregs of the NFL! YOU WILL NOT MAKE THE PLAYOFFS! For the next seven weeks, these 11 teams exist only to screw up three-team teasers, generate \"Will (fill in the blank) get (fired or benched)?\" headlines, feed our fantasy football addiction, ruin any eliminator pools that arent over yet, provide unintentional comedy fodder, and (in the case of Chicago, anyway) ruin their citys collective will to live. Your 2014 cross-offs: Oakland, Tampa Bay, Jacksonville, Tennessee, both New York teams, St. Louis, Washington, Houston, Minnesota, Chicago, and Chicago a second time.\n\nBefore the WWE hijacked every U.S. pro wrestling corner, smaller promotions in Texas, Georgia, Memphis and Canada survived by developing their own stars. Many times, those stars would leave for bigger promotions like NWA or WWE, only it was wrestling, so theyd \"leave\" by losing what was called a \"Loser Leaves Town\" match. In the NFL, those matches start happening in Week 11 -- one or two \"Loser Leaves Town\" (or in this case, the playoff picture) games that actually mean something. Like Miami (now 6-4) knocking out Buffalo (5-5) last night. Sayonara, Buffalo. See you in 2014. And get out of town, Michael Hayes!\n\nA November staple covering any fan base that gives up on the current season, starts dreaming about the next drafts franchise-saving QB (in this case, Marcus Mariota), shifts into rooting-against-my-own-team mode, then watches in abject horror when they cant even tank the season correctly. You know, like the Jets upsetting Pittsburgh last Sunday. Congrats on the win, Jets fans! Say good-bye to the Marcus Mariota era! Enjoy the anonymous 6-foot-8 right tackle youre drafting!\n\nWe saw it before Week 10 when Lovie Smith inexplicably benched the vaguely promising Mike Glennon for the not-promising-whatsoever Josh McCown. And we saw it again this week when Jeff Fisher claimed that 25-year-old Austin Davis would remain St. Louiss QB for the rest of the season, then inexplicably benched him two days later for 34-year-old Shaun Hill. And why? According to Fisher, \"\n.\" Experienced in what? Losing? Since 2010, Shaun Hill is 3-8 as a starter! Thats like Fox firing John Mulaney from \n because it wanted to lean on a more experienced actor like Ian Ziering. Coaches LOSE THEIR SHIT in November.\n\nIn October, as coaches and players get more and more frustrated, press conferences start getting angry-wonky. And thats how you end up with moments like this.\n\"IF YOU WANT TO CROWN EM, THEN CROWN THEIR ASS! BUT THEY ARE WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE! AND WE LET EM OFF THE HOOK!\"\nThanks, Coach. But in the Weeks 10-11 range, as teams and fans start giving up hope, press conferences become more sad-wonky. And thats how you end up with a lifelong YouTube headline like \"Bucs QB Josh McCown cries in post-game press conference.\"\n\nAnd it manifests itself in occasionally hilarious ways. Like \n begging for volunteers for the Bucs overmatched offensive line. Or Chicago fans responding to that Packers-Bears annihilation by \n. Actually, Bears fans are so bitter that, when \n wrote an article \n for Chicagos woes, Bears fans believed it was real \n. All bets are off in the bitterness/biting-humor departments when your team sucks in November. Speaking of Cutler ...\n\nFirst the foliage changes, then comes Halloween, then the Cutler-George email barrage, then Thanksgiving. Those emails usually resemble this recent one from Andrew in Las Vegas: \"Why hasnt anyone compared Jay Cutler to Jeff George yet? Big arms, tremendous upside, misanthropic QBs who always stink it up but put up big numbers. If smoking Jay Cutler grows a mustache, this comparison is a lock. Cutler through 2014: 26,030 yards, 172-121 TD-INT, 85.5 rating. Georges career: 27,602 yards, 154-113 TD-INT, 80.4 rating. Jay Jeff George Cutler.\" Please, hold this thought for when we get to the Bears section of this weeks picks.\n\nI love when this happens. See, Week 11 is when one-third of your fantasy league realizes that it cant make the playoffs. That leads to one of the following three outcomes: (a) someone making a shady trade to help a buddy, (b) a checked-out owner forgetting to sub out a starter on a bye, (c) someone whos been mathematically eliminated grabbing the best waiver-wire free agent anyway, just to be a total dick.\nWhat happens next? Any of these three events trigger a leaguewide email chain that starts off as a ball-busting thing and degenerates into mean-spirited barbs that keep degenerating ... and degenerating ... and if someone doesnt squash the chain, potentially, someone will cross the line with something like, \"Thats why I hooked up with your girlfriend in college, because YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE.\" And then the email chain dies and everyone pretends it never happened.\n\nReally, that team revealed itself in Week 10 ... but we didnt realize its identity until Week 11. The obvious candidate here: Arizona losing all Super Bowl believability after Carson Palmer went down ... or did it? (Well get to that later.)\nThe stealth candidate? This one hurts ... I blew it. Last Friday, I posted my \n, made a bunch of M. Night Harbaughlan jokes and received two subsequent emails that made me want to injure myself. I cant believe I missed it. Dammit. Anyway, those emails ...\nDrew in Seattle: \"I want this on record now after your Week 10 picks. The Niners have quickly become the Nobody Believes in Us team. Everyone is so concerned about Harbaugh leaving and not paying attention to the fact that they are clearly the most dangerous team. Have wins over the Boys and Eagles (so they win any wild-card tiebreaker) plus still have one Arizona game that could be for the division. Niners are going to run the table and finish 12-4. They will then meet your beloved Pats in the Super Bowl and what happens then, well, probably cant show that on network tv. Hope you run this email, after all of this comes true.\"\nMichael in Santa Barbara: \"I just saw another headline titled Are the 49ers done? This follows a stream of trade rumors, reported tension, mutiny, insider trading, treason, and ebola. Its official -- nobody believes in the 49ers. The remaining schedule is: @NO, @NYG, WASH, SEA, @OAK, @SEA, SD, ARI. I suspect they will be a good, healthy team by the time they host the Seahawks on Thanksgiving. They are in most successful road team over the past 3 seasons. They can win 6 of their remaining games. And NOBODY BELIEVES IN THEM! Not even Vegas. The 49ers are 25/1 odds to win the Super Bowl. Let that sink in for a second. They are going to peak at the perfect time. If they have a ticket to the dance, they are posed to make a run like the 2011 Giants. The 49ers at 25/1 is more enticing than your Royals bet at 18/1. (By the way, why didnt you and Sal hedge?)\"\nAnd now? Theyre 17-to-1. And theyll probably be 7-4 in two weeks ... with that Thanksgiving home game against Seattle waiting. Hmmmmmmmm. Is it too late to believe that nobody believes in the Niners? Quickly, heres the case for the Cardinals.\nPunnet in Phoenix: \"\n you wrote about the Cardinals transitioning from a nobody believes in us team to an everybody believes in us team. Now that Carson is out with a torn ACL and Stanton is in, were back to nobody believes in us! Has any other team transitioned so quickly? It captures what it means to be an Arizona sports fan -- you oscillate back and forth with legitimate hope and depression about your teams.\"\nBen C. in Tempe: \"I cant believe this! (No Im not mad, Im happy). Yes, Carson Palmer obtaining a potentially career-ending injury 2 days after obtaining a 3 year contract extension is pretty depressing, but think about the most important ramifications of yesterdays game. Not only did the Cardinals win, but we went from being the possibly-over-hyped- too-much-confidence-team to once again.... wait for it.... NOBODY BELIEVES IN US!!! There is a white guy who loves wearing kangol hats who is very ready for the rest of this season. P.S. sorry Carson.\"\n(So ... Niners or Cardinals? Ill give my verdict later in the column. Lets hope nobody believes in my verdict.)\n\nEvery November features one bonkers gambling Sunday that crushes absolutely everyone. Bonkers Gambling Sunday always happens in Week 11, 12 or 13; it always features at least two big-money dogs winning outright along with two other crazy endings that send Vegas into a tizzy; and it always ends with Chris Berman declaring on Sunday night, \"And Teej, that was one WILD Week (fill in the number) in the National Football League.\"\nBecause Im a masochist, I love knowing that Bonkers Gambling Sunday is coming, then insisting on betting and trying to brazenly avert the Bonkers Gambling Sunday land mines the way youd sidestep cars if you stupidly walked across a highway. WARNING: Bonkers Gambling Sunday might happen this weekend. The favorites went 10-2 last Sunday/Monday and climbed over .500 against the spread in 2014. In other words ...\n\nThats the acronym for \"Roger Goodells annual botch job thats limping toward the holidays with an unclear conclusion that will definitely not cost him his job as the national media intermittently pretends to care while ultimately just looking the other way.\" (I really need to work on getting better at acronyms.) This time around, the Goodell-Rice saga somehow made it to mid-November without a clear resolution to the question \"Why did Goodell re-suspend Rice without any new evidence, and why did he pretend that he DID have new evidence?\" The two-day independent hearing concluded on November 6. Hold on, Im not good at math ... wait, that was eight days ago. Whats going on? Why dont we have a ruling yet? It has taken eight days and counting to digest a two-day hearing? No wonder this country is so screwed up.\n\nBy Week 11, theres always one under-the-radar divisional wager with sneaky-great odds lurking out there. So whats that wager in 2014? Im glad you asked! Its the 6-4 Ravens fetching +260 odds to win the AFC North. Just do the math.\n Theyre 6-4 with a fairly easy schedule remaining (@TN, bye, NO, @Cin, @ATL, KC, Cin), but thats also the problem. Mike Tomlins Steelers teams love blowing games to NFL doormats -- as you might have noticed last weekend, or if you frequent Reddits NFL page and stumbled across the \n. Remember, THIS was the team that blew a playoff game to Tim Tebow. Throw in the actual news headline \n and I dont know how the Steelers are finishing 9-7 ... but theyre finishing 9-7.\n Andy Dalton already sucked the life out of their season; theres a really decent chance that Sundays Superdome blowout loss (and you know its coming) will earn him the Matt Schaub Award, given annually to the once-competent starting QB from a playoff team who becomes so shellshocked that it overwhelms his teams playoff chances. If/when they lose in New Orleans, the Bengals will be 5-4-1 with home games against Pittsburgh and Denver and road games at Houston, Tampa Bay, Cleveland and Pittsburgh left. Put it this way: Katherine Webb is probably doing a one-week juice cleanse to get ready for all the camera time shes about to get.\n Jumped to a 6-3 start thanks to the NFLs easiest schedule. As Todd in Denver put it, \"My excitement over the Browns current first-place standing, even as a lifelong Cleveland fan who has been battered and bruised since being born shortly before Red Right 88, is \n.\" You mean it might be a red flag that Clevelands nine 2014 opponents have won only 36.9 percent of their games? Throw in Clevelands history and ... I mean ...\n Maybe theyre 6-4, but the Ravens rank second overall in DVOA (12th offense, ninth defense, second special teams) and have only two \"hard\" games left (at New Orleans in Week 12, at Miami in Week 14).\n Theyre also riding the residual karma of how wonderfully they handled Ray Rices situation from start to finish, especially the part where Ravens owner and frequent Roger Goodell golf buddy Steve Bisciotti held a 45-minute press conference to discredit ESPN.coms September 19 \n report that \"\n\" after Ray Rices elevator attack, then followed up by saying nothing about them ever again.\nHeres how I think it plays out. Everyone but Cincy has a chance to steal the division heading into Week 17. Pittsburgh blows it by squandering a home game against AJ McCarron and the Bengals, allowing their fans to torture themselves for the entire offseason and bemoan all the dumb games they lost in 2014. The New Browns could clinch the division by beating the Old Browns in Baltimore, only its Cleveland, so you KNOW how that one is turning out. (I wouldnt be surprised if Baltimore won this game on a Hail Mary. Dont rule it out.) And Cincy loses the division by a half-game because of Andy Dalton, but also because Mike Nugent couldnt make a 36-yarder in OT against Carolina -- if he makes that, they finish 10-6 and win the tiebreaker over Baltimore (whom they beat twice), only he didnt, so theyll miss the playoffs because God hates Cleveland AND Cincinnati.\nAnd the Ravens? They cash in your +260 division bet before the Karma Police finally crush them in their Round 1 home game against the Chiefs. Hold on, lets bring in Panic at the Disco covering Radiohead.\nDid we cover everything? I think we did! Heres how I think the playoff picture plays out (and Im picking games accordingly) ...\n Pats, Broncos, Colts, Ravens, Chiefs, Dolphins\n\n\n Cardinals, Eagles, Lions, Saints, Packers, Niners\nHold on, we have to give Cowboys fans a couple of moments to regroup. You guys cool? Can we finish the column? The Week 11 picks ...\n(HOME TEAMS IN CAPS)\n\nLets just say that I wasnt backing Kyle Orton in a \"Loser Leaves Town\" match -- especially against a talented Miami team that has Indy fans quietly hoping they will NOT grab the no. 6 seed. (You know its true, Indy fans.) We need a depressed email from a Bills fan.\nBS: You were so close. Great concept, solid execution ... but wouldnt it make much more sense to have an aching case of Blue Bills? Even emails from Bills fans about blue balls end up giving you reading blue balls.\n\n\nBS: The year after Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl, the Patriots lost four straight games to knock themselves out of the 2002 playoff race. His numbers for those four losses: 906 yards, 6 TDs, 7 INTs, 69.1 rating. The Pats put up 39 points total in the last three losses, followed by everyone in Boston wondering if we screwed up by trading Drew Bledsoe. Heres the point: Its way too early to worry about Russell Wilson. Seattle has a shaky offensive line and no game-breaking receivers. Hes in a tough spot. Seattle just isnt that good.\n I love the Chiefs this week. (Please, Lord, dont let Andy Reid make me regret this.)\n\n\nBS: And he always needed a nickname! Now he has one -- The Coverer. Good Lord, did I do enough to jinx the Chiefs minus-2 yet? Lets just move on.\n\nIts the Bummer Bowl. Lets not air this game, please.\n\n\nBS: Im a big believer in second chances if theyre earned, so no. Id rather see the Vikings work with Peterson to become an advocate against child abuse, much like how Michael Vick raised so much awareness for animal abuse. Peterson could have an impact if he wanted to have one. Does he now understand that he went way, way, WAY overboard in disciplining his son? I sure hope so. Does he now understand that its not a good idea to whip your 4-year-old? I sure hope so. If hes not interested in learning from his mistakes, or figuring out how those mistakes could help other people ... then, and only then, would I release him. Who wants to root for someone like that?\nBS: Please, remember to tip your waiters and waitresses!!!!!! As promised earlier, here were two Jay Cutler moments from previous columns just to bang home the longtime Cutler-George parallels.\n \"I received so many Jay Cutler is the next Jeff George e-mails these past three weeks that Im going to have to run one just to stop the influx (from Tony in St. Louis): Isnt Cutler the Jeff George of this era? He has it all: rocket arm, surly disposition, can turn a fan base against him at the drop of a hat. Will he impress one front office after another with his physical skills only to ultimately disappoint and move on after two years? Prediction: In 2022, a wheelchair-bound Al Davis signs balding, 39-year-old Jay Cutler to a two-year, $66 million contract with the Raiders. Then cuts him five days later.\"\nAnd \n ...\n(The lesson, as always: Jay Cutler is probably Jeff George.)\n\nThe Browns are in first place in mid-November for the first time in 20 years!!! What could go wrong? How can the Tree of Brady matchup (\n) NOT be decided by somebody driving Brady-style for a game-winning field goal in the final minute? Im grabbing the extra half-point. Meanwhile, you might remember me writing about Ryan Fitzpatrick being one of the least successful starting QBs ever last week. Reader Nathaniel Lee went on Pro-Football-Reference.coms Play Index, cracked the numbers of everyone who started at least 85 games, and yielded \"four distinguished gentlemen, of whom Fitzpatrick has the HIGHEST win percentage.\" Those numbers:\nAdds Nathaniel, \"I find it cosmically satisfying that Peyton and Elis dad was essentially the least successful QB in NFL history.\" (Hold on, Im not done pumping my fist yet.) I mean, stop being so petty, Nathaniel.\nBS: Shes the craziest character in the history of television. Its like Showtime took Glenn Closes character from \n, stuck her in the CIA and hid her meds. She nearly drowned her baby in the bathtub during the first episode this season and it didnt crack the top five craziest things that Carrie From \n has done. And yes, I can make fun of her, because shes a fictional TV character and Im pretty sure there arent any real-life mentally ill people who continued to gain power at the CIA even after they ran off with a terrorist who tried to blow up the vice-president. Anyway, I wish \n would do a sketch in which Carrie Matheson became an NFL sideline reporter.\nCarrie: Im here with Mike Tomlin -- what do you guys need to change in the second half?\nTomlin: We gotta get rid of these turnovers, were really hurting ourselves right now.\nCarrie: And if you want to know the truth, youre also hurting me.\nTomlin: What do you mean?\nCarrie: You know what I mean.\nTomlin: I dont ... weve never met.\nCarrie (makes crazy Carrie face): Weve never met. (Laughs crazily.) Weve never MET? We met at the Super Bowl three years ago!\nTomlin: What?\nCarrie: In Rita Bensons suite ... we walked by each other, you said hi, I said hi back.\nTomlin: I mean, I dont remember.\nCarrie: I totally remember.\nTomlin: I have to go to the locker room.\nCarrie: Fine, go!\n\n\nBS: I think the best part of that case was \"The game was played in New Jersey.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Falcons have two wins since Week 1: both against Tampa Bay. They suck outdoors. Their coach might get fired any week. And yet ... theyre suspiciously, curiously favored for reasons that cannot be explained? Hmmmmmmmmmm. Meanwhile, you know what I am definitely NOT doing? Laying 7.5 points with the 2014 Washingtons or grabbing Andy Dalton in the Superdome. Thanks anyway.\nSpeaking of things Im staying away from, heres the Shakeys Pizza Watch for Week 11: the Tom Coughlin era, NYGs secondary, trying to be a 10-win team with Kyle Orton, Balts secondary without Jimmy Smith, Miamis O-line without Branden Albert, Jay Cutler in any Packers game (1-10, 22 INTs!), Pittsburghs run D, the accuracy of Bad News Blake Bortles, Drew Brees as a top-five QB, Sean Paytons entire 2014 season, Derek Carr, Chicagos defense/offense/coaching/chemistry/mojo/past/present/future, Joe Philbins clock management.\n\n\n\nDenver played two below-average teams this season (the Jets and Raiders) and beat them by a combined score of 72-34. So ... yeah. But if were headed for Bonkers Gambling Sunday, then either the Rams or Chargers are winning outright. (FYI: The 2014 Chargers shouldnt be favored by 10-plus over anyone right now.) You are NOT allowed to tease these teams together, regardless.\nIn other news, Stephen Thompson in Ottawa believes the NFL should have designated the Raiders-Chargers game as a \"Loser Moves to L.A.\" match. Now THAT would be a sporting event. I wish we could bet on stuff like \"L.A. is definitely getting two teams next season.\" Its happening. My money is on the Raiders and Rams.\n\nPatrick Willis is out for the year, NaVorro Bowman is heading that way, Michael Crabtree is unhappy ... NOBODY BELIEVES IN US!!!!! By the way, ESPN.coms Mike Sando keeps track of \"explosive plays,\" which covers any rush of 10-plus yards and any pass of 20-plus yards. According to Sando, the \n per game, the worst single-season figure dating back to 2001. In a related story, Tom Coughlin is one year older than my father. My dad and I just had the following conversation about this weeks episode of \n (re-airing on Sunday at 4 p.m. ET on ABC and 11 p.m. ET on ESPN2):\nMe: Did you like Jalens \"Keeping It 100\" segment?\nDad: I didnt understand it. 100 what?\nMe: It means \"keeping it real.\"\nDad: Keeping what real?\nMe: Everything. You know, telling the truth about stuff.\nDad: What does that have to do with the number 100?\nMe: Its just an expression.\nDad: Does it mean that Jalen is hot? Like, hes 100 degrees?\n(Again, Tom Coughlin is one year older than my dad.)\n\n\nBS: Once again: My dad is one year younger than Tom Coughlin. Id like to pick the Niners a second time. As for the rest of the Sneaky-Good Watch: Marcell Dareus, Matt Stafford throwing on the run from weird arm angles, the Chris Borland/Anthony Barr Defensive ROY race, Clevelands offense when Josh Gordon comes back, Preston Parker, Mike Evans, the Percy Harvin trade for the Jets, Matt Hasselbeck being my Vocal Doppelganger, the readers who want every awkward Mike Carey breakdown of every atrocious Jerome Boger call to be nicknamed \"Picking Bogers.\"\n\n\n\nThats right, I am backing Drew Stanton AND Mark Sanchez this week. LETS DO THIS! In the words of 2016 President-Elect Bruce Arians: \"We can win the Super Bowl with Drew Stanton. There is no doubt in my mind.\" To be fair, there is some doubt in my mind. Lots, actually. But I like going against the Packers after an easy Sunday-night blowout win, and I love the Cards in the Nest giving fewer than three. Sign me up even though I apparently have magical jinxing powers. Here, look.\nBS: Put it this way ... I could have kept running those for another 200 emails. Sorry, Arizona. Just know that an Internet column actually does NOT have the ability to shred someones ACL. Its been proven by scientists and everything.\n\n(I know I wrote that I believed in the Colts as a serious playoff contender just two weeks ago, but now theyre playing my favorite team on Sunday night and I have to switch gears. I know you understand.)\nIndys six victories in 2014: Jags by 27, Titans by 24, Ravens by 7, Texans by 5, Bengals by 27, Giants by 16. Congrats on those grueling wins against such tough competition, Indy!\nNumber of points New England scored in its last five games: 201.\nNumber of points Indy gave up to Hall of Fame QBs in 2014: 82 (Pittsburgh and Denver).\nOver/under on emails from Giants fans furious that I dont think Eli Manning is a Hall of Famer: 577.5.\nAnd now, its time for the weekly good-luck charm Patriots email ...\nBS: That email gimmick hasnt lost in 2014! Lets do this!\n\nThe Titans have scored 56 points total in their last nine halves. And in the words of Forrest Gump, thats all I have to say about that. Meanwhile, Dennis from New York sent me this life-altering email: \"Thank you for introducing me to the 1987 Crystal Light Aerobics Challenge video. I work at a medium size brokerage firm in NYC, and it has become a tradition for me and my co-workers to watch that video every Friday after the stock market closes.  It has become our unofficial way to start the weekend.  I discovered a similar video (this one with former notable pro athletes) that I believe you will enjoy in a similar vain. I especially think you might enjoy as I know of your distain for the NY Football Giants.\"\nWell, I watched it. And its glorious. Watch the first 30 seconds just for the horrible editing and the 1980s porn-movie parallels, which are both extensive, confusing and magnificent. I kept expecting to see Ginger Lynn and Peter North. No dice. From there, fast-forward to 2:24 for the important stuff. My favorite parts in order ...\n2:30 - Todd Christensens hair.\n2:30 - Todd Christensens mustache.\n2:40 - Todd Christensen trying to talk and move in rhythm.\n3:01 - Check out Phil McConkey! Are we sure he never made an adult film? Are we sure this isnt it?\n3:14 - If CBS announced tomorrow, \"Weve just seen Phil Simmss aerobics video from 1987, and weve decided to release him from his contract,\" would you be shocked? Be honest.\n3:29 - \"Go Phil, you funky guy, you!\" What?\n3:40 - Comedy equals tragedy plus time, and comedy equals Phil Simmss aerobics shorts multiplied by time.\n3:50 - If everyone ripped their clothes off and started going at it right now, you would NOT be surprised.\n4:01 - \"Hey, Phil, its time for the cool-down, and Im about to be abruptly and hilariously edited, Im outta here.\"\n4:30 - I was alive in the 1980s and none of this seemed remotely strange. You have to believe me.\n4:48 - The blonde who just hijacked the video definitely went to her hairstylist and asked for \"The Sikma.\"\n5:02 - CBS just fired Phil Simms again.\n5:09 - Please, watch Christensen in the background. I beg you. I double beg you.\n5:14 - \"I think youll find that youll look better, feel better and improve your athletic performance, whether its tennis, squash, skiing, wind surfing, or any other sport that wealthy white women do.\"\n5:24 - \" ... \n5:37 - CBS just fired Phil Simms for a third time.\nThank you, Internet. Thank you."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/welcome-to-the-week-12-thunderdome/", "blog_text": "When your mailbag question inspires me to email multiple friends and colleagues asking for their answers, then congratulations -- youve completed the Mailbag Video Game. Theres no parting prize other than my eternal respect. A reader accomplished that feat this week with a question involving Rob Gronkowski and J.J. Watt. Before we answer it, lets rip through a couple of undercard questions relating to those chiseled maniacs first.\nBS: We have the same son -- Ive been pulling a Gronk on mine at least four days a week for two straight years. Theres nothing funnier than fake-wrestling a completely fearless little boy who weighs three times less than you. Theyre like a cross between a pinball and the amped-up dog in \n. So as the dad, your job is to make sure neither of you get injured. That means youre always straddling the line between \"Im gonna let you keep beating me up because thats my job here\" and \"OK, if you hit me in the balls one more time, Im throwing you into some sofa pillows.\"\nThats Gronk in every football game when hes 100 percent healthy, with one crucial difference -- when Im \"wrestling\" my son, Im carefully picking him up by his chest and throwing him into a bunch of pillows. When Gronk turns the tables on an opponent, the word \"carefully\" isnt involved. That dude ends up getting bowled over or \"\n\" (Gronks words) like poor Sergio Brown getting introduced to NBCs cameramen last Sunday. Hes my favorite Patriot of all time. Its not close, actually.\nHeres how much I love Rob Gronkowski: I havent written a full-fledged Gronk column because I cant risk putting the Simmons Stink on him, seeing him suffer another dumb injury because yet another safety cowardly took out his legs when Gronk wasnt looking, watching in horror as another Lombardi vanishes into a puff of smoke, then sentencing myself to a lifetime of head shakes from my father and caustic emails from bitter Patriots fans. No way. There will be no Gronk column.\nBS: And you didnt even mention this wrinkle -- in a 30-year span from 1956 (when the award was created) through 1986, \n. From 1987 through 2013, QBs won or shared the award in 20 of the 27 years. And its not like that number is dropping; not after they changed basically every rule to benefit quarterbacks. Im with Patrick -- we need an MVQ and a MVP. Just know that, through 11 weeks in 2014, the MVQ is Aaron Rodgers and the MVP is Gronk.\n(The quick case for Gronk: When hes 100 percent healthy, the Pats immediately become a genuine Super Bowl favorite that drops 40 points a game on anyone and everyone. No other non-QB alters a 2014 NFL teams destiny that severely. Also, Im a giant homer.)\nBS: It took two people to come up with that email! You need to tweak the concept a little -- it should measure greatness combined with disdain combined with an absolutely overpowering physical component, otherwise every great athlete would qualify. And I think you need the aforementioned Dad/Gronk factor: When an athlete looks like hes plowing through little kids even though hes actually playing with highly trained adults.\nBut you nailed the current LeBronk Mount Rushmore, even if you omitted Mike Trout, whos been patiently waiting for one of those four spots to open. (Thanks for being such a trouper, Mike.) If youre thinking about historical LeBronks, overpowering freaks who pop right into my mind include Bo Jackson, Randy Moss, Calvin Johnson, Charles Barkley, Lawrence Taylor, Mark Bavaro, Serena Williams, Earl Campbell, mid-80s Boris Becker, Wilt Chamberlain, Young Eric Lindros, Reggie White, Andre the Giant, College Jadeveon Clowney, Georgetown Patrick Ewing, post-1998 Barry Bonds, and Bo Jackson a second time. If you want to make the case for anyone else, drop me an email. All right, lets answer our main-event mailbag question.\nBS: Yes! Yes! Yes! This is a GREAT mailbag question. I sent it to eight friends and coworkers asking for short responses. Heres what they wrote back.\nThe J-Bug (Pats fan): \"Gronk by 1 1/2 . And Gronk wins. This already happened less than a year ago -- Pats-Texans, Pats won, Gronk had 1 TD and 130 yards.\"\nGus Ramsey (Broncos fan): \"Watt by 4. Gronk is sure to get hurt during the fight or at least stunned when Watt says Bet you cant spell my first name. (Watt wins.)\"\nCousin Sal (Cowboys fan): \"This is Vegas Zone -- Gronk by 4 1/2 . And the Pats beast prevails.\" (Note: We had to delete the follow-up joke here, but it was really funny and lets just say that one of Gronks former teammates was involved.)\nRobert Mays (Bears fan): \"Watt by 4 1/2  -- he gets an extra point-and-a-half for the 30-pound advantage, and instead of homefield advantage, Im giving Watt what Ill call a Maliciousness Advantage. Gronk comes off like a genuinely affable guy (to people that arent Sergio Brown) that happens to SMASH for a living. I get the impression that Watt actually enjoys wiping people off the face of the earth. Oh, and he once said \n to \n.\"\nDave Jacoby (Pats fan, Tebow fan): \"Watt by 7. He was born in a Thunderdome. (Gronk wins.)\"\nAndrew Sharp (Cowboys fan): \"Watts definitely favored by 3 1/2  because hes real-life Bane and his quotes to Mays still scare the crap out of me. But my heart will never let me pick against Gronk. In anything. (Gronk covers by +3.5 bodyslams.)\"\nJoe House (D.C. fan): \"This really strikes me as the classic \n conundrum for which, according to the internet, the line \n. But I like the bears claws against the bulls relentless charge so Watt BARELY wins.\"\nKevin Wildes (\n enthusiast): \"Watt by 6. But Watt grew up with two giant younger brothers; Gronk grew up with two giant older brothers. Gronk now has the physique of an older brother and the mindset of a younger brother. Unstoppable combo. (GRONK WINS.)\"\nMy take: Its a dead-even matchup, which means Watt is favored by three because you get three points for playing at home. Mays tapped into the crucial point -- J.J. Watt is just \n than Gronk. I could see Gronk jumping to an early advantage, heading to the precipice of finishing Watt off, then backing off because hes such a happy guy. And thats when Watt would turn into Bane and flip the fight -- with Gronk as Arnold in \n, just refusing to lose even as parts of his body are coming off. And at some point, even Bane Watt would gain so much respect for Gronk that hed decide NOT to finish him off, so wed have one of those Sean Penn/Esai Morales/\n-type endings with Bane Watt passing up the final death blow as the crowd watches in respectful silence, then helping a bloodied Gronk to his feet, then trying to raise Gronks arms so they could share the victory, only Gronk doesnt have any arms left to raise. So Watt wins the Thunderdome fight, but Gronk wins our hearts. Again.\nLets tackle the Week 12 picks ...\n(Home teams in caps.)\nWhy I picked against the Chiefs (\n): \"Trap Game + 8 Straight KC Covers + Were Overdue for An Andy Reid Game.\" I think that makes me Nostrasimmdus! Never change, Andy Reid. Never change.\nBS: And ... theres your problem with the Chiefs. You cant be one-dimensional for four straight playoff rounds. Its never worked. (Those K.C. receivers put up 9.5 points last night, by the way.) Heres the strange thing: For all their faults, the Chiefs were (and are) the scariest AFC matchup for the Patriots. Why? Because New Englands defense was carefully designed to shut down high-powered passing games ... but you can run on the Pats, and theyre also susceptible to goofy misdirection plays and screen passes and wide receiver screens and all of that other Reid-like crap against them. Thats why every smart Pats fan was rooting for Oakland last night. Even if we believe we can beat the Chiefs, wed rather not find out (and the tiebreaker implications helped too).\n\n\nBS: I loved it so much. It reminded me of watching my daughters fourth-grade basketball games when one of our opponents shot at the wrong basket\n -- in other words, you couldnt even get mad because you knew who was involved. Thats right, the Oakland Raiders, the only NFL franchise that can be successfully compared to a fourth-grade girls basketball game!\n\n\nBS: No question -- they sadly poured out 40s. So did every Lions fan. Dont worry, Detroit -- were giving you an awesome Jets-Bills game on Monday to make you feel better. Enjoy.\nBS: You may have just laid out the blueprint for our first six-OT playoff game. Thats just one of many particularly goofy Round 1 scenarios in play, including ...\n* Chiefs at Bengals: The Heimlich Bowl?\n* Packers at Atlanta/Carolina: Our first-ever 14-point playoff home dog!\n* Broncos at Baltimore: Rahim Moore, the Sequel.\n* Broncos at Indy: Peyton comes home!\n* Dolphins at Chiefs: The emotional 24th-anniversary reunion matchup of my first extraordinary NFL playoff bet -- January 5, 1991, Chiefs +2.5, \n.\n* Seahawks at Cowboys: Romos Redemption or Romos Boner 2.0, with no in-between.\n* Lions at Packers: Wouldnt this be the greatest Lions win of the past 50 years?\n* Steelers/Bengals at Cleveland: Wouldnt this be the greatest Browns win in 20 years?\n* Detroit/Cleveland at anyone: Wouldnt this be the greatest Lions/Browns win in 50/20 years?\n* Seahawks/Niners at Packers: Who wants some star power???\n* Packers at Cowboys: NBC just had an orgasm.\n* Anyone at Detroit: A Lions home playoff game with Jim Caldwell coaching ... I mean, what could go wrong?\n* Ravens at Cleveland: Please, nobody tell God about this game.\n\nOnly four NFL coaches have won 100 more regular-season games than theyve lost: Don Shula, George Halas, Paul Brown ... and William Stephen Belichick. All hail Belichick! Lets play some celebration music and find me a mosh pit! Sing it, Weezer!\nBS: Do you really think I care? Were averaging 40.5 points a game since Week 5! Gronk is the most beloved Boston athlete since Pedro! Jonas Gray just ran for more yards than any Pats running back in 31 years! Were heading for a no. 1 seed! Sing it, Two Goofy Buddies Covering Weezer on YouTube!\nBS: (Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.)\nBS: This is threatening to become the dumbest-yet-most-successful tradition in the history of my column. Its the Nelson de la Rosa of Internet mailbag gimmicks.\n\nWould you want to live in a world in which Mark Sanchez lays this many points against a vaguely frisky Titans team? And will I ever forgive myself for taking the Sanchize in Lambeau last week? No and no.\nBS: Id jump on that Eagles +170 bet. I cant see any scenario in which the 2014-15 Sixers reach 10 victories -- thats a gruesome disgrace of a roster. Even though their front office played the bottoming-out thing correctly on paper, the fact remains, theyre disgracing the sport and defecating on their season-ticket holders. Do you realize that the Sixers have lost 43 of their last 47 games? They single-handedly inspired NBA fans to consider the Premier Leagues relegation concept. And actually, Id go further: If you lose 70 games and get outscored by 15-plus points per game for the entire season,\n then ...\n* Youre relegated to the D-League for one season.\n* You cant be eligible for a top-three draft pick.\n* Your season-ticket holders should get the next season for free.\nWould we ever see mega-tanking along the lines of the 2014-15 Sixers if those three penalties were in place? No way. Regardless, its time for Adam Silver to react here. Right now, hes handling it in the most Goodellian way he can -- by looking the other way for as long as possible until the media forces him into a corner. You dont want to emulate the worst sports commissioner of all time. Bad strategy. Hey, that reminds me ...\n\nWelcome back, Josh Gordon! You know him as the guy who taught us all a valuable lesson: that the current NFL commissioner could keep his job after believing the penalty for getting high twice should be five times greater than the penalty for brutally punching out a woman in a casino elevator. You also know him as the guy who caught nine TDs and averaged 117.6 receiving yards per game in 2013 (\n), as well as the guy \n (lets add that to Gordons resume for the next LeBronk conversation). And hes going against the 32nd-ranked defense on turf in a game between two dead-even mediocre teams. Ill grab the extra half-point, thanks.\nBS: So ... things are looking up!\nBS: Apparently not! Throw in LeBron and the possibly-maybe-sort-of-rejuvenated Browns and maybe God is softening. It cant be ruled out. I mean ... Bill Cosby AND the Dolans??? Thats the most Clevelandish scenario ever and we somehow avoided it. Again, THINGS ARE LOOKING UP, CLEVELAND!\n\nFact: Four of the 2014 Colts six wins have been by 16 or more points.\nFact: Six of the 2014 Jags nine losses have been by 14 or more points.\nTranslation: Im playing the blowout odds even though Ahmad Bradshaws broken fibula leaves the Colts with Trent 2.9 and some guy named Boom as their running backs. When youre the Good Bad Team, you blow out bad teams. That reminds me ...\n\n\nBS: Interesting -- a Bad Good Team! I like it. Thats the biggest reason I picked the Steelers to finish 9-7 last week; they love blowing dumb games to lesser teams (and almost did it again on Monday night). P.S.: If you thought the Eagles had a case over Indy for being the Good Bad Team (especially after giving up 53 in Lambeau), dont forget -- we settled that argument in Week 2 when Philly beat Indy in the Good Bad Team Bowl.\nBS: I noticed that Landry moment, too, especially because Al Michaels joked that Landrys biceps made him look like Popeye. Oh, and it happened just seconds after NBC had flashed a graphic under Landry that read, \"SUSPENDED 4 GAMES: PEDs.\" Heres how Landry \n: \"Im a lean guy ... High protein, high carbs. Always fruits and veggies, and I stay on top of the protein meal-replacement shakes.\" In September, he was suspended because of what \n \"perhaps the least-surprising performance-enhancing substance violation in NFL history.\"\nAnyway, if we are supposed to believe the NFLs company line (that the league cares about player safety and the long-term health of its employees), then why hasnt the NFL emulated baseball by attempting to rid the league of PEDs with the best testing possible? How could NFL owners think that its latest PED testing \"improvement\" was to \n? Lets see ... 40 multiplied by 17 equals 680, only the league employs more than 1,600 players at any given time, so youd have less than a 10 percent chance of being tested for HGH once a month (giving you plenty of time to finish a cycle) ... I mean, thats cleaning up the game???? Why isnt this the leagues biggest priority right now? Does the league even have a big-picture priority right now other than cashing checks, sweeping mistakes under the rug, changing punishment standards on the fly, and belatedly pretending to care about domestic violence and other forms of abuse? Dont get me started.\n\n\nBS: I told you -- dont get me started! I feel obligated to point this out ...\n2014 Vikings, home: 2-2\n\n2014 Packers, home: 5-0, four wins by 20-plus points\n\n2014 Packers, away: 2-3, losses by 12, 20 and 21 points, one miracle win (Miami).\nOh, and this, too ...\n2014 Packers, Weeks 10-11: Packers 108, Opponents 34\n\n2014 Packers, Week 13: Home for New England\n(Translation: trap game + inflated line = take the points.)\nBS: Hmmmm ... lets see ... maybe youre failing to account for the storied recent history of the NFL settling every controversial case in the most confusing, hypocritical way possible? Its pretty easy to guess how that ugly Peterson saga went down -- the league didnt want Peterson playing until his child-abuse charges were settled, so it made a wink-wink deal with the NFLPA to put Peterson on the commissioners exempt list. Once the charges were settled, Goodell was obviously leery of the ensuing hullabaloo that comes with a to-that-point unrepentant child abuser suiting up for an NFL team, so it reneged on that wink-wink deal and suspended Peterson without pay for the season.\nAnd now, Peterson is suing because the NFL prevented him from playing football for four straight months because (a) he was accused of what was eventually a \n,\n and (b) he didnt show enough public remorse about it. You know where I stand on Peterson -- I wrote about it \n. But no sports commissioner should be able to prevent employees from working for four solid months and/or change the CBA rules on the fly, especially when that same commissioner is already dealing with major credibility issues over the way he handled another complicated issue that -- by the way -- required a two-day appeal hearing THAT STILL HASNT YIELDED A VERDICT 15 DAYS LATER EVEN THOUGH THAT VERDICT IS ALMOST DEFINITELY GOING TO REVEAL THAT THE COMMISSIONER ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY AND PRETENDED HE DIDNT HAVE EVIDENCE THAT HE ACTUALLY HAD.\nI mean, are you freaking kidding me???? Why do you think NFLPA president Eric Winston \n, in which he summed up the players feelings about Goodell like this: \"There is a growing discontent. There is a strong questioning. There is confusion, and then the anger sets in, and then [they ask], What is he doing? All we have ever heard is, \n. I think guys are starting to ask themselves now, how can we protect the integrity of the shield if you are not going to act with any integrity?\"\nI liked \n: Instead of sentencing the player for the actual crime, \"In the end, Goodell is punishing Peterson for not feeling the right things, while believing [back in June] Ray Rice did. Ray Rice played the game well, and Adrian Peterson did not. Its a shitty way to decide NFL suspensions, and an even worse way to decide a jail sentence.\" Agreed. Not to mention -- how can anyone base punishment decisions on the concept of remorse when he doesnt seem to feel any remorse for his own inadequacies and his own indefensible decisions?\nLast point: Only the NFL could turn horrible father Adrian Peterson and horrible fiance Ray Rice into something remotely approaching the word \"victims.\" But when youre being blackballed from pursuing your chosen profession because your employer keeps changing its rules on the fly, resuspending you without new evidence and/or pretending that it never knew about overwhelmingly relevant evidence to your case (even though all signs say otherwise), then whats the right word? And why would anyone trust the commissioners office, as currently set up, to make the right decision about ANYTHING? These are great questions. I have no answers.\nYou know whats really crazy? All of this is probably leading to the Vikings releasing Peterson, then a rejuvenated Peterson returning home to Texas, taking a discount to play for Goodells buddy, Jerry Jones, and unleashing holy hell on the NFL next season as a learned-from-his-mistakes redemption story playing for the leagues most profitable franchise. This doesnt seem fishy at all.\n\nLets lighten the mood -- I received a ton of feedback about last weeks unveiling of Phil Simmss incredible 1987 aerobics video.\nThanks to the readers for pointing out four things that I missed in my recap: First, they used Bananaramas \"Venus\" for the entrance music shortly after using what appears to be the late Dick Schaap for voice-overs. That has to be the only time Dick Schaap and Bananarama worked together, right? Second, Simms mistakenly introduces Gary Anderson as \"Jerry Anderson\" at the 1:50 mark, then corrects himself a few seconds later, only nobody made him do a second take. Incredible. Third, I missed Simms asking at 3:50, \"Wheres Dickerson?\" followed by a second of silence and Todd Christensen answering quietly, \"He left.\" And fourth, I couldnt figure out the right way to describe Christensens performance in this video until reader Eric Scolaro decided, \"Todd Christensen has the screen presence of an abusive husband in a Lifetime movie set in the South.\" There you go. Done. Anyway, this email blew my mind ...\nBS: No! No! I am fighting you off! There will be no two-hour rabbit hole! No way!\n(Thinking.)\n(Well, maybe just a couple. Ill be right back.)\n\n\nBS: Yeah, but this means I have to bet on Andy Dalton. No thank you.\n(By the way, fast-forward to 1:24 of this 1986 Giants link to hear Phil Simmss mid-1980s \"accent.\" In all caps ... HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.)\nBS: Thanks for the email. I do not believe in Andy Dalton. Last weekend was a setup. Hes roping in the Bengals fans one last time before he squeezes them into his minivan and drives them off a gambling cliff. You are NOT getting me inside that minivan.\nBS: And that is why I dont believe in Andy Dalton. By the way, that would be a fun football version of \n gimmick that we launched this week with Channing Tatum vs. Bradley Cooper. Who has the Upper Hand right now -- Andy Dalton or Jay Cutler? Or, lemme flip that around -- who has the Lower Hand? Theres no answer. It cant be answered. And no, I cant take Andy over J.J. Watt in Houston. I just cant. This is a setup.\n\nCan you think of a better QB matchup in an empty stadium filled with six feet of snow than Michael Vick and Kyle Orton representing the beleaguered Jets and the perpetually heartbroken Bills? Would you pick any other location, teams or QBs? I was fully prepared for one of the 10 greatest gambling moments of all time ... and then they moved the game to Detroit. Then again, what better way to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the \n then a special football event featuring two star-crossed QBs and two depressed franchises! Can we bring John Green to this game and have him toss the ceremonial pregame Diet Coke?\nBS: Its the Jets -- you should probably bet on the first one.\n\nHold on, weve reached my favorite part of the Friday picks bag: the Jay Cutler Section.\n\n\n\n\nBS: Great email and I loved the Green Bay part. Do Packers fans still love Brett Favre? Have they just moved on to Rodgers like hes the much more likable second spouse and Favre was more of the first spouse who was fun for a while until everything fell apart? Would they defend him to outside parties? I have no feel for this story. Then again ...\nBS: Ladies and gentlemen, one more time, give it up for Green Bay Packers legend Brett Favre!\n(P.S.: The over/under is 18 months.)\nBS: Im going the other way -- Im buying Cutler stock. If hes going down in flames, I think hes going down as someone who just runs the 1990s \n offense -- seven-step drop, wing the ball downfield, hope something good happens. (Thinking.) Wait, thats what Jeff George did in Oakland. Forget it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSG: (I think my brain just broke.)\nBS: Hilarious. By the way, heres some good news \n: \"Tampa Bay is now very close to being the best last-place team in DVOA history.\" Please, drink and drive responsibly, Tampa Bay fans. Wait, why do I think youre beating the Bears this week? And why do I think youre gonna be a game out of first place with five weeks to go even though no offshore betting account will even allow us to wager on you to \n? Am I insane? Im not insane, right?\n\n\nBS: Notice the time stamp. And yes, I got a few of those emails from Seahawks fans. Scott from Seattle even wondered, \"Has the combination of age, overwork, and stress from running your own site finally caught up to you?\" and added, \"Theyre winning that division -- Easily.\" I dont see it. You dont have the same talent, you dont have a single receiver who can break a play or even get himself open on a third-and-12, your defense doesnt kick the same level of ass and (lets face it) the 12th Man got a little soft. You know I love the good people of Seattle. But this is the 2014 Seahawks right now.\nBS: SHOTS FIRED!!! Obviously, you picked the right week to push the concept of \"Eli Manning Good\" since he just threw five picks for the second time in his career, while also putting himself in position to become the fifth QB to win back-to-back interception titles. But since 1987, Id say the 1987 D.C.s (Doug Williams), 1990 D.C.s (Mark Rypien), 2000 Ravens (Trent Dilfer) and 2002 Bucs (Brad Johnson) definitely qualified as \"Eli Good.\" You covered the 2014 Cards already, but Stanton reminds me of Rypien and Dilfer in this respect: He throws a pretty deep ball, which keeps defenses honest and creates the chance for one to two big plays per game. Ideally, you want your \"Eli Good\" QB to throw deep and avoid crushing turnovers. Stanton might be able to do that.\nNow heres where Giants fans will say, \"Wait a second, Eli was lights-out in 2007 and 2011! He went 8-0 in the playoffs, beat Brady twice, beat Rodgers in Lambeau and won an awful-weather game in Candlestick! He orchestrated two game-winning drives to win Super Bowls! He threw 15 TDs and just two picks! Eli Good means good, you bitter dumbass!\" Or, its an eight-game sample size and Eli was two plays away from going 6-2 with no rings. Im the wrong person to ask.\n\nCan you smell it? Can you smell the upset brewing? I think Miami either wins this one or gets screwed on a late call because its Peyton Manning and God forbid the refs let Peyton Manning lose two weeks in a row. (Im only half-kidding.) Regardless, you are NOT allowed to throw the Broncos on the two-team teaser this week.\nBS: I feel like someone just tried to repaint the \n. Thats how I feel. You cant even \n remaking the greatest holiday song ever without every A-list voice from this generation -- and even then, youd never consider it if it wasnt for a good cause. But for Bono to come back to THAT? And THAT lyric? Oh my God. Why not just rerelease the greatest holiday song ever with everyone resinging their parts? Im so bitter. Id be madder about this if Bono didnt just get injured in a cycling accident. Get better, Bono.\n\nThe Chargers have scored 54 points total since Week 6; they cant block anyone. And they have the 31st-ranked defensive DVOA. Which brings me to my Crazy Proclamation of the Week: I dont think San Diego wins again this season. They go STL, @Bal, NE, DEN, @SF, @KC. In the words of James \"Baby Doll\" Dixon, I wish them a lot of luck.\nThe rest of the Shakeys Pizza Watch for Week 12: San Diegos injuries, K.C.s receivers, Andrew Luck against the Pats (144-66!), the Wes Welker era, the post-Bountygate Saints, any scenario in which Kim Kardashian takes naked pictures and then tries to play the victim card, RG3s rookie cards, John Foxs clock management, \n as an airplane movie, Andre Ellingtons every-down-back-ness, Jay Grudens Jay Gruden-ness, Branden Olivers fantasy stock, Cordarrelle Patterson, the mental state of all Philly sports fans, Ron Riveras Riverboat Ronness, every Jerome Boger game, Denver on the road, Washingtons O-line without Trent Williams, Washingtons everything.\nBS: Not fair at all, totally out of bounds ... and it made me giggle. If Gregg Williams is going down, hes going down with what brought him here!!!! SWEEP THE LEG, ROBERT QUINN! DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT???\nBS: I already came up with it a few weeks ago -- theyre the Best Ball team. Even if theyre heading for 20-over for the season, they can always tell their wife when they get home, \"I eagled the Denver game and had birdies against San Francisco and Seattle!\" And yes, I think they par this Chargers game pretty easily. Nice drive, good approach, two-putt.\n\nThanks to everyone who sent me the RG3/Billy Ray Valentine comparison jokes, starting with my buddy Gus on Sunday night. Whats funnier \n? Meanwhile, Jim Harbaugh is 2-0 since we ran those M. Night Harbaughlan emails and has his defense going again (Aldon Smith helps), so Im willing to overlook the glaring Trap Game potential here just because the Snyders are such a travesty. If the Niners win Sunday and beat Seattle on Thanksgiving, that makes them 8-4 with one easy road game (Oakland), one hard road game (Seattle), one semi-easy home game (San Diego) and one potentially easy home game (Arizona If Arizona Already Clinched the No. 1 Seed). Feels like 11-5, right? I still think Dallas loses that rock-paper-scissors wild-card battle with San Francisco and Green Bay/Detroit.\nBS: This Seattle-San Francisco rivalry is really heating up!\nBS: Im taking that as a compliment. Speaking of compliments, heres our Sneaky-Good Watch for Week 12: Chris Borland, the Julius Peppers rejuvenation, the Niners D with Aldon Smith back, the Clowney-Watt combo, any football player named Jonas, Aaron Rodgers at home (last nine games: 26 TDs, 0 picks), the Justin Forsett era, all Oakland night games in bad weather, Brian Hoyers fantasy stock with Josh Gordon back, Mike Evanss potential as the Next Freak Receiver, \n.\n\nIts official -- Im no longer afraid to go against Drew Brees at home in a night game. Hold on, lemme get my 40.\nBS: Are you crazy? There are three games on Thursday! You think they want the verdict hanging over those Thanksgiving games? I have \"9:02 a.m. on the morning of Black Friday\" as the over/under for the Rice appeals verdict.\nBS: (In my Marv Albert voice) A \n ... email ... from Matt in Oxford.\nBS: Whoa! Its been awhile. Are we in range?\n\n\nBS: Were definitely in range.\nBS: Yup, these are my readers."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-week-13-mailbag-giving-thanks-making-picks/", "blog_text": "On Sunday night, I thought I had a foolproof plan: Watch \n with my son, record the Giants-Cowboys game on DVR, then rip through the second half of football after wrestling ended. Of course, I never expected to miss the most randomly thrilling in-the-moment football catch ever made. Yeah, I saw it afterward -- after people started texting me and emailing me about it, after I said to myself, \"Theres no way it could have been THAT good\" -- then watched in horror as Odell Beckham Jr. pulled off \n.\nYou know what? This one hurt. I watch an insane amount of football every week. Im probably in the 99.5 percentile for \"Most NFL Football Watched.\" Thats the case for rational reasons (its my job), selfish reasons (I love watching football), financial reasons (Ive enjoyed a wager or 10,000 in my life), self-loathing reasons (fantasy football), emotional reasons (I love the Pats and hate anyone who gets in their way) and social reasons (many of my friends, family members and coworkers also love football).\nBut theres one other part, and its probably my favorite: I dont want to miss anything. I dont want to miss any Hail Marys, 80-yard runs, kick returns, pick-sixes, cheap-shot tackles, indefensible Mike Smith decisions ... I dont want anything to slip by me. Thats the fun of being a football fan. You never know whats gonna happen next, so you obsess over monitoring EVERYTHING just so you dont miss those rare moments that actually matter. Missing that Beckham catch live damn near killed me. Seeing 55-year-old Sting \n wasnt exactly a consolation prize that softened the blow.\nSo how great was the Beckham catch? Will it stand the test of time? Its certainly the most acrobatic NFL catch ever -- highest degree of difficulty, greatest display of athleticism, you name it. But it also happened in the middle of a Giants loss during a completely forgettable Giants season. You cant call it the GREATEST catch when it had no \n impact other than owning the Internet for about 18 hours.\nMy short list of greatest catches is determined by the following formula: \"degree of difficulty\" plus \"impact in the moment\" multiplied by \"the stakes of the game itself.\" So Lynn Swanns Super Bowl tip catch is way up there. Same for Santonio Holmess Super Bowl-winning catch, Franco Harriss Immaculate Reception and the Tyree FML Helmet Catch. And the truth is, Tyrees catch is probably your answer. He caught it off his helmet, fended off Rodney Harrison, somehow kept the ball from hitting the ground and single-handedly swung a Super Bowl. Oh, and he never caught another pass. So thats a worthy candidate.\nBut what if youre a giant homer who cant live in a world in which the obvious choice (the Tyree FML Helmet Catch) is your answer? Then youre going off the board. So I believe that Terrell Owens made the greatest catch ever. Lemme set the scene ...\n1998 playoffs. Wild-card round. Green Bay at San Francisco.\nYou have the Montana-Young-Rice era holding on for one last run, desperately trying to fend off Apex Brett Favre and a Packers juggernaut coming off two straight Super Bowl appearances.\nYou have Candlestick Park, an iconic NFL stadium, the home to five Super Bowl champs and a significant, Celtics-like level of championship pride.\nYou have the Niners trailing by four points, stuck on Green Bays 25, with just eight seconds remaining.\nYou have Owens crossing the middle, finding about 10 inches of open space between five Packers, catching a perfect pass from Young while knowing that hes about to get annihilated by two safeties (remember, these were the old \"JACKED UP!\" rules).\nYou have Owens somehow holding on for the game-winning touchdown even as hes bouncing off two Packers like its a three-car collision.\nTheres only one way that catch could have been greater: if Owens had laid motionless on the field for 45 seconds, made everyone fear for his life, then hopped up and performed a flawless Rod Tidwell impersonation.\nOther than the Tyree FML Helmet Catch, I was more amazed by that T.O. catch than by any other important NFL catch Ive ever watched. And if thats not enough, the GOAT announcing team (Madden and Summerall) were announcing ... and Pat Summeralls voice even jumped a couple of octaves! Watch the video and let Summerall do the rest.\nWhats better than that? Beckhams catch was spectacular and impossible, but it also didnt mean anything. Tyrees catch was impossible and inconceivable, but when you factor in the rest of his underwhelming career, youd have to call it at least a little lucky. (Do me a favor -- just concede me that point, and Ill concede that Im a humongous homer.) Swanns catch didnt win the Super Bowl, although it set up the game-clinching drive. Santonios catch (and Dwight Clarks The Catch,\" as well) were unforgettably clutch catches that also could have been made by dozens of players.\nBut that T.O. catch ... I mean, how many receivers in NFL history had the talent and speed to find that 10-inch hole on a do-or-die play, run the perfect route, haul in the football while knowing that an absolutely hellacious double hit is coming, then survive that double-barreled hit while holding on to the ball? Maybe eight or nine guys? Add everything up and its the greatest catch I have ever seen. Just tell me when we see another playoff game end with THAT catch.\nTheres one bonus moment from that clip: The introduction of the Brett Favre Face at 8:20 ... along with the introduction of the \"Wait, Why Are Brett Favres Head and Neck Seemingly 20 Percent Larger in 1998?\" conversation that I hope youll have with your friends after you finish reading this column. I love that clip so much. Long live Summerall and Madden, long live Favres swollen neck and noggin, long live Candlestick, and long live the T.O. catch.\nLets hit the Week 13 picks, starting with the three Thanksgiving games.\nDetroits offense dropped 35 on the Giants in Week 1. And then it turned into Greg Monroe: seven points in Week 2, then 19, 24, 14, 17, 24, 22, 20, 6 and 9 points last week. Thats 16.2 points per game for that 10-game stretch, the same number as the lowly Raiders and less than a point higher than Monroes 15.3 this season. Check out these scoring numbers since Week 2 (throwing out defensive TDs and special-teams TDs) ...\nGeno Smith, Mike Vick and New Yorks offense: 158 points, 16 TDs\nDerek Carr and Oaklands offense: 155 points, 17 TDs\nMatthew Stafford and Detroits offense: 146 points, 15 TDs\nBlake Bortles and Jacksonvilles offense: 144 points, 16 TDs\nSorry, Detroit -- thats not a slump, thats something else. (The fact that \"Megatron\" turned into \"Calvin\" this season aint helping.) On the flip side: Chicago (303 points allowed) belongs to the ignominious 300 Club, created for teams that somehow allowed 300 points before Thanksgiving.\n If Detroits offense doesnt get going this week, its \n happening. Then again ...\nBS: 2009s Flabbergasted Four starred Romeo Crennel, Andy Reid, Herm Edwards and Brad Childress. Who qualifies for the 2014 edition? Jim Caldwell, Mike Smith, Andy Reid ... whos our fourth? Somebody alert the dudes at Bindledog!\n\n\nBS: Shouldnt \"Jay-and-Pray\" just be 50 percent of their offense? Lean on Matt Forte for runs and screens, send the big receivers over the middle every so often, then spend the rest of the time unleashing Jay-and-Prays? I fully support Chicago embracing San Franciscos early-1990s \n offense.\nBS: That was one of the better responses to last weeks reader email wondering if (a) Brett Favre and Jay Cutler were closer as QBs than anyone wants to admit, and (b) Packers fans still loved Brett Favre. More than a few Packers fans DID defend Favre, although the collective sentiment mirrored the feeling behind the next email.\nBS: Translation -- Favre was our first love and a thrilling roller coaster ride, but Rodgers has been a better and safer long-term relationship. So basically, Packers fans are like McNulty in \n. Sounds great. Hold on, we need one pissed-off Packers fan to weigh in.\nBS: YEAHHHHHHHHHHHH! Brett Favre lives! Sing it, Eddie!\nIn \n, we discussed splitting up the MVP award into two different trophies (the MVP and MVQ). This week, Im piggybacking on a point from \n: Should Dallass offensive line be one of the 2014 MVP favorites along with Aaron \"Relax\" Rodgers and Tom \"Everyone Gave Up On Me In Week 4\" Brady?\nI cant imagine enough voters ever backing an offensive line over a franchise QB, no matter how good that O-line is. So why couldnt we just create the MVU award for \"Most Valuable Unit\"? If were using end-of-the-season awards to capture who mattered most -- not just as an in-the-moment prize, but also to create some sort of historical legacy -- then an MVU award makes a ton of sense. 2013s MVU winner would have been Seattles secondary. 2014 would belong to Dallass O-line, barring an unexpected turn of events. Going backward, units like the 1999 Rams receivers and the 1986 Giants linebackers would get their just due. Fun idea.\nAnyway, I see Dallass O-line dominating yet again on Thursday -- even though the NFL screwed the Cowboys by sticking them with a Sunday-nighter followed by a Thursday day game. Saying the NFL cares about player safety is like saying the 2014-15 Sixers care about their fans. That reminds me -- two readers took last weeks \"Should the Sixers be relegated?\" conversation even further:\nBS: Yeah, thats a problem. You cant force 15 NBA players to sit out a season. But we actually have this rule in my West Coast fantasy football league -- 11 franchises, 10 spots, the previous years winner gets to \"vote out\" one team before every draft. Its always exciting, but it peaked in 2012 when our crazy friend Brad nearly snapped after getting voted out. Here, look:\nI dont know how you capture that magic for a professional sports league, but heres one possible way: We make Seattle a franchise-in-waiting. If any other franchise loses 70 games AND gets outscored by 15 points per game, Seattle immediately assumes control of that team. Like, for good. That roster become the Seattle SuperSonics for the following season; meanwhile, Philly becomes the franchise-in-waiting and cant get another team until someone loses 70 games AND gets outscored by 15 points per game.\nAsk yourself this: If this rule were in place ... would any NBA franchise even \nabout tanking a season as egregiously as the Sixers are throwing away the 2014-15 season? No way. Not a chance. By the way, kudos to these Yeshiva University students for sneak-attacking David Stern for this picture last week:\nBS: How dare you! And after I gave you the Sixers AND posted the Stern/Sonics photo? HOW DARE YOU! To be fair -- I wouldnt have taken the Cards +6.5 in the Clink if I knew Larry Fitzgerald was out. But Arizonas D beat up the Seahawks offense in that game; four days later, the Hawks have to battle San Francisco? And Im giving less than three points with San Frans suddenly excellent defense in a do-or-die game? Yes, please.\nBS: And hes playing on Thursday night! Niners giving one! Sign me up! DOUBLE MY BET!\nBS: I think the Hyde Bandwagon takes a test run on Thursday night. (And Im sitting in the third row.) By the way, can you remember a better \"looking terrible for the first three and a half quarters while also making you believe that hell absolutely pull out the game-winning drive\" QB than Colin Kaepernick? I mean, other than ... well ...\n\n\nI like backing Andrew Luck against crap football teams; I like backing J.J. Watt at home against bad QBs; and I like betting on QBs who lost their job and then awkwardly regained the position thanks to an injury. Oh, wait, I like only two of those three things. \nAnyway -- in \n, we broke down a hypothetical Thunderdome fight to the death between Watt and Gronk. You sent me a slew of email responses; Id say about 80 percent of them backed Watt, with Carlos in Houston even declaring, \"JJ Watt eats pain like candy. JJ Watt stares at the sun and the sun blinks. JJ Watt is Smaug. Gronk is Puff the Magic Dragon. JJ Watt is a polar bear. Gronk is a panda bear.\"\nBut Matt in Dallas made the strongest case: \"Gronk and JJ Watt a dead-even matchup? Are you kidding me? Spoken like a bunch of little guys who never played real football. JJ Watt dominates OFFENSIVE LINEMEN, Gronk dominates safeties and linebackers half his size. Watt would obliterate your boy in seconds. Do you know why JJ outweighs Gronk by nearly thirty pounds? Because he has spent his entire football career developing back, shoulder, and chest muscles and physical techniques that allow him to move guys around that outweigh him by thirty pounds. Im 63 and 280, played right guard in college and would fight Gronk just for the story. You couldnt pay me to fight JJ Watt.\"\nYeah, but still.\nFYI: The odds of Sammy Watkins coming back to haunt the Browns on Sunday are already off the board in Vegas.\nBy the way, do you realize how close Cleveland was to turning that into one of the best trades of the century? I thought they should have just stayed at no. 4 and taken Watkins, if only because (a) theyre not exactly loaded with impact guys, and (b) the thought of a post-suspension Josh Gordon-Watkins combo is just plain petrifying. Instead, they moved down a few spots, picked up Buffalos 2015 first- and fourth-round picks and drafted cornerback Justin Gilbert ... who hasnt exactly been Joe Haden 2.0 so far. Youd rather have Watkins than Gilbert and Buffalos pick, obviously.\nOK -- imagine if the Browns made the same trade, only they picked Odell Beckham Jr. Would you grab Buffalos first-round pick just for the slight \"downgrade\" from Watkins to Beckham that might not even be a downgrade since theres a 27 percent chance that Beckham is actually Spider-Man? Of course! OF COURSE! The Browns were so damned close. The lesson, as always ... well, you know already.\nBS: Um ... is it \"possible?\" Are you kidding? \n should be a 2014 football movie starring Brian Hoyer and Kyle Orton. They could switch faces/teams right now and wed have no idea for like three years. Not even their wives would know. \nSpeaking of shaky, heres the Shakeys Pizza Watch for Week 13: Drew Stanton playing from behind on the road ... Megatrons prime \n Seattles O-line \n Blake Bortles going 29 spots ahead of Teddy Bridgewater \n the Cordarrelle Patterson bandwagon \n Mark Sanchez even when hes leading by 17 \n Josh McCown starting over Mike Glennon when youre 2-8 \n the Hanley Ramirez signing \n Indys running backs \n Indys running backs a second time \n any defense that doesnt blitz the living hell out of Andy Dalton \n any \n scene when the guy who plays Abraham tries to go 1970s Pacino on us \n every end zone fade route \n the phantom holding on Tavon Austins game-swinging kick return in San Diego (single worst call of the season) \n all grand juries that dont return indictments when a cop fires more than 10 gunshots and kills someone, nobody knows what happens and multiple witnesses have different accounts of what actually happened \n any prosecutor who tries to explain that non-indictment and comes up more condescending than \n.\nThe 2014 Ravens are starting to look a little playoff-sleepery -- theres a lot to like from a football standpoint.\n (Just not from an organizational standpoint.) Meanwhile, last weeks Crazy Proclamation of the Week (\"I dont think San Diego wins again this season\") came within a Shaun Hill end zone pick of staying alive for San Diegos brutal last five weeks: @Bal, NE, DEN, @SF, @KC. Theyre too banged up to win in Baltimore.\nBS: Youre welcome. That brings us to this weeks Crazy Proclamation of the Week: I dont think San Diego wins again this season. Thats right ... were running it back!\nBS: Excellent points. The first 12 to 13 Bettman years set the standard for commissioner incompetence. So if you want to argue that Roger Goodell is ON PACE to becoming the worst sports commissioner ever, thats fine. But I think hes already there.\nBS: Im in on any and every Goodell conspiracy theory. You cannot throw one at me that I wouldnt believe.\nBS: Its quite a league. Even \n!\nBS: I dont know if its realistic. But we can dream, right?\nThe Rams just survived a brutal 3-6 stretch against quality teams with a combined record of 61-27;\n amazingly, they could have gone 5-4 if two plays had gone differently in the Cowboys and Chargers games. This is a fancy way of telling you that this Raiders line might be three points too low. The Rams are somewhere between \"frisky-decent\" and \"sneaky-decent,\" but not quite sneaky-good. Regardless, heres the Sneaky-Good Watch for Week 13:\nMiami as the \"Better Than You Think\" team ... Belichicks belichickian burial of Jonas Gray in Week 12 ... Indys Good Bad Teamness ... Andy Dalton in non-televised afternoon games that are available only in a couple of markets ... the unintentional comedy of every \n promo ... wagering against Brian Hoyer in Round 1 ... any and all Jarvis Landry stock ... the Pablo Sandoval signing ... \n ... Calais Campbells DPOY potential in a non-J.J. Watt world ... any \n ... \n as a ridiculous-but-keeps-your-attention airplane movie ... Cris Carters ESPN work (enjoyed him this season) ... RG3s Reclamation Project potential \n ... Minnesotas rebuilding potential ... every Julian Edelman punt return ... Grantlands weekly newsletter (\n!).\nBS: The short answer: Nobody can play their way OUT of the Hall of Fame. Joe Namath won a Super Bowl in Year 4, then submitted eight straight lousy seasons before retiring: 71 games, 65 starts (25-40 record), 12,176 passing yards (171.5 YPG), 50.0 completion percentage, 76 touchdowns, 116 interceptions, 59.9 QB rating.\n Eli is making the Hall of Fame. Even though its hard to imagine any Hall of Fame QBs laying only three points to the 2014 Jags.\n(Speaking of Eli: Isnt it funny that he threw two errant passes that led to two of the most memorable football catches ever? If theres ever a game show/reality show pitting retired receivers against one another called \"The Most Incredible Catch,\" Eli has to be the QB.)\nBS: The good news: You shouldnt jump to conclusions with any rookie QB playing behind such an abysmal offensive line. The bad news: Bortles has tallied 15 picks, five fumbles and just eight passing TDs, along with an impossibly low 21.8 QBR. Thats really, really, really, really dreadful. Since 2006, only six qualifying QBs dipped under 25 QBR.\n2013 Brandon Weeden: 24.7\n\n2007 Kellen Clemens: 22.3\n\n2011 Blaine Gabbert: 19.1\n\n2006 Andrew Walter: 17.4\n\n2009 JaMarcus Russell: 11.6\n\n2010 Jimmy Clausen: 11.0\n(Thats a murderers row. Literally -- they murdered seasons. What a terrible omen for the Blake Bortles era. But hey, at least Sammy Watkins and Khalil Mack werent the next two 2014 draft picks after Bortles.)\nBS: I vote for the London Redcoats or London Monarchs. If you caught me before I spent a month there in 2012 (for the Olympics), my answer would have been either the London Douchebags or the London We-Kicked-Your-Ass-In-1776ers. But I actually like London now. Six things I never thought Id like that I actually like: London, sushi, Chris Bosh, Dodgers fans, Joe Buck and a Pitbull song.\n(Rereading that last sentence.)\nUm ... lets agree NEVER to discuss this again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mississippi River is flowing with the blood of the NFC South!!! My god, where do we begin?\nBS: If the Saints win the NFC South, at least we could halfheartedly talk ourselves into the whole Superdome/Brees/Payton/mega-underdog thing. If the Falcons win it, at least we could talk ourselves into the whole Ryan/Julio/Roddy/Georgia Dome/high-scoring thing, only it would be combined with the compelling possibility of Mike Smith botching one last big game in the final two minutes. But if the Panthers win it? I mean ... I dont even like when the RedZone channel throws it to Carolina for 15 seconds. Theyd be the first-ever \"Nobody Believes In Us OR Wants To Watch Us\" playoff team. I really hope that doesnt happen.\nBS: That would be awesome if Goodell held a press conference just to announce, \"Look, you guys know that I make shit up as I go along, and that I belatedly overreact to whatever way the public wind is blowing. Thats my calling card, and thats how youll remember me. So for one time only, I have decided to use my powers in a positive way. Starting this season, only teams that finish .500 or higher can make the playoffs. And on that note, I am taking a leave of absence -- my daughter Stephanie and her husband Triple H will be taking over the NFL, effectively immediately.\"\n(P.S.: I have been advocating the \".500 or Higher\" playoff rule for years now. If you cant go 8-8, you shouldnt be a playoff team. Then again, the thought of a Seahawks-Saints Reverse 2010 Round 1 Situation is pretty damned exciting. So is the not-so-insane possibility of a 5-10-1 or 5-11 team being a no. 4 seed, or a coach being fired even though hes in first place. Im enjoying the NFC South Train Wreck. I cant lie.)\nBS: As you can tell, we had two finalists for this weeks \"Mike Smith Might Need To Go\" email contest. I loved Doms email, but it couldnt top Aruns astute observation, \"he seems to completely forget what hes supposed to do with his arms.\" Your winner: Arun from Brooklyn! You get a free Blu-ray of the upcoming 30 for 30 about Smiths unforgettable Game Management Fiasco-Off against Jim Caldwell in Wembley, \n. And yes, Mike Smith prevailed in London because Mike Smith is the Mike Smith of Clock Management.\n(Wait, Im being a little too mean to Mike Smith. Somebody throw a glass of water in my face, please.)\nBS: I asked for a glass of water, not a glass of Scotch. Jesus! That burned my eyes! Thats it, Im playing some Pitbull.\nThe top four most insulting gambling spreads of the Brady-Belichick era ...\n* No. 1: STEELERS (-10) over Patriots, \n* No. 2: RAMS (-14) over Patriots, \n* No. 3: CHARGERS (-5) over Patriots, \n* No. 4: PATRIOTS (PK) Colts, \nShould this Packers line crack that illustrious group? The Pats have been underdogs in three of the last four weeks ... even though theyre 9-2 with a plus-130 point differential. They havent lost since the day before the Royals-As wild-card game. Theyre averaging 39.6 points since Week 5. They won six of their last seven by 15 points or more. Theyre second in DVOA and weighted DVOA, with Football Outsiders now projecting them \n. And theyre 32-3 in Weeks 9 through 16 since 2010.\nThe case for Green Bay: Theyve been great at home, Rodgers has been on a tear, and its been five whole weeks since THEY GOT THEIR ASSES HANDED TO THEM IN THE SUPERDOME BY A SAINTS TEAM THATS NOW 4-7. I could understand the Packers being favored by 2.5 or even 3. But 3.5??? Thats insulting. Thats Vegas saying, \"home-field advantage is worth three points, and were throwing in an extra half-point because we think Green Bay is better.\" I hope Belichick writes \"3.5\" on the chalkboard on Sunday while running this clip on a loop:\nBS: God, we sound waaaaaaaaaay too confident right now. I dont like this at all. Lets throw some water on this fire.\nBS: Youre talking to someone who worries about Gronk every single play. Its like reliving Pedros 1999-2000 apex in this respect -- every pitch after 90 pitches (or in Gronks case, every play, period), Im worried about something bad happening. Hes like a walking Lombardi Trophy.\n I support any plan that includes the words \"Lets keep Gronk healthy for January and February.\"\nBS: I was just saying that.\nBS: I hope we never find out.\nBS: The Douche Train rolls on! And kudos to Eric from NYC for allowing New York to have an ongoing impact in one of the three biggest American professional sports this year.\nGet well soon, Eric Berry.\nBS: Hes not even kidding. When did New York and Cleveland switch places? Last week, I passed through JFK Airport and they were \n. He retired almost two months ago! Why not sell Mantle and DiMaggio while youre at it? The Yankees dont have one marketable active player for the JFK gift shop? What happened? How sad it is that Mike and the Mad Dog getting back together would be the single biggest New York sports story of the past two years? I dont know how to follow sports when I dont have at least three semi-threatening New York teams to hate at all times. Get your shit together, New York.\nBS: I mean ... when youre bemoaning the day you let Drew Stanton go, youve really hit rock bottom.\nBS: I think about this every time I watch an episode. Nobody showers, uses soap or washes their clothes, which means the B.O. Factor has to be a 28 out of 10 at all times. Everyone goes to the bathroom outside. You cant go 12 hours without killing multiple zombies and getting sprayed with zombie guts. There are tens of thousands of rotting zombies littered across Atlanta. My guess is that it smells so continuously appalling that, after a while, you cant even notice the stench because your brain adapts and learns how to shut off its sense of smell. In other words, its just like rooting for the Jets.\nBS: Fair enough. And on that note -- Happy Thanksgiving and happy 10th birthday to Rufus Simmons. We finally got a dog to double figures.\nhttp://youtu.be/H0mlhfNwGZM"}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-week-14-mailbag/", "blog_text": "Two quick plugs, because its officially the holiday season and I will NEVER catch you in a more charitable mood.

In other words, Im the New York Knicks of football handicapping. Its too bad I never opened a fancy office on the 11th floor of a New York City high-rise, hired a bunch of businesspeople, pretended that I knew something about business, then allowed \n \n in which I said things like, \"This isnt just about me picking games anymore, I want to be bigger than that\"; \"How can I be known for being a visionary, for being truly great?\"; and \"picking football games, business ventures, tech -- Im just hoping to be remembered for doing something great,\" even though Ive never been that good at picking games and Ive never had an 11-0 playoff run against the spread. That would make me the Carmelo Anthony of football handicapping.\nBS: Youre right, the Dallas O-line lost the MVU title on Thanksgiving before dominating the Chicago Bearzombies last night. Replacing them as 2014s MVU favorites as we head into the homestretch: a unit called \"J.J. Watt and Any Three Other Guys.\" On the off chance that you missed \n, heres all you need to know:\n* Theres a 5.78 percent chance that Watt actually read my breakdown of \n, then said to himself, \n* For the record, that \"Micd Up\" video DID swing the Gronk-Watt Thunderdome line. J.J. Watt is now a -500 favorite. And climbing. I cant remember five badass action-movie lines in the history of action movies better than Watt yelping, \"All I know is, you mess with me, YOU GOT PROBLEMS!\" Its the \"Youre the disease and Im the cure\" of \"Micd Up\" moments.\n* The footage of Watt repeatedly shredding Tennessees offensive line (at least 12 different times, he overpowers someone and touches the QB somehow) and punctuating it by belittling those opponents on and off the field ... I mean, you have to see it to believe it. HE KNOWS HES MICD UP THE ENTIRE TIME. AND HE DOESNT CARE. What was funnier: J.J. complaining to an official about a holding no-call with, \"Im beating these guys like a drum out here!\" or J.J. belittling a Titans lineman by sarcastically asking, \"You gonna hold all day, or just part of it?\"\n* Dont sleep on Houstons assistant coach coming over to Watt on the sideline and saying, \"Keep wreaking havoc out there, baby!\" and then cackling maniacally like hes Ivan Dragos trainer circa 1985. I loved that part. How many football players are so overpowering that they make their coaches cackle maniacally?\n* The unedited three-minute sequence of Watts strip-sack, Watt running back to the sideline and whooping it up with teammates (\"WOOOOOOOO!\"), then Watt getting called back onto the field to catch a short TD pass ranks up there with the opening scene of \n and the one-shot \n scene as one of the most unforgettable unedited one-camera sequences of all time. Fine, thats an exaggeration. But its freaking great. I loved it.\n* Dear Hollywood: For Gods sake, write a quickie action movie that Watt can film this spring called \n Heres the plot: J.J. plays a star defensive end named James Wattman who retired prematurely from the fictional APFL (the American Professional Football League) after the evil APFL commissioner (Roger Goodman, played by Bill Pullman) unfairly penalized Watts team (the New Orleans Canes) for allegedly hatching a bounty scheme to injure other players that turned out to be WAY overblown, only the team was decimated by suspensions and blew their chance at the APFL title.\nDisgusted, Wattman abruptly quits the APFL to become a Navy SEAL, wins the Medal of Honor for some crazy Middle East mission gone wrong, then just-as-abruptly retires from the Navy SEALs. (By the way, this all happens in three months.) Hes living on a sprawling ranch in Texas when President Obamas new sports czar, Will Bimmons (played by Jason Bateman), approaches Wattman to unretire and \"return\" to the Canes.\nBimmonss goal: to bring down Commissioner Goodman by gathering evidence against the APFL for its callous disregard for player safety, concussions, PED use and an illegal painkiller ring that involves 10 APFL teams (including the Canes) as well as the biggest Mafia boss in New Orleans, Santino St. Pierre (played by Alec Baldwin). Heres the scene in which Bimmons unexpectedly visits Wattman on his ranch to convince him to come back.\nBimmons: Youre a hard man to find.\nWattman: Not that hard.\n[\n]\nWattman: Go get it, Schauby.\nBimmons: You know who I am?\nWattman: It doesnt matter what I know. You have 90 seconds.\nBimmons: I only need 45.\nWattman: Then go.\nBimmons: I need you to come back to the Canes.\n[\n]\nWattman: Im done with football.\nBimmons: Its not \n football. I need you to bring down Goodman.\nWattman: Goodman? F- - -  that guy.\nBimmons: Exactly.\nWattman: Why me?\nBimmons: Because youre the best. I didnt want to have to go to Gronkowski.\nWattman: Gronkowski? [\n] Hed screw this up.\nBimmons: Thats why Im here.\nWattman: At least youre not a total idiot.\n[\n]\nWattman: So whats in it for me?\nBimmons: One last job. Thats it.\nWattman: Then Im out?\nBimmons: Youre out.\nWattman [\n]: No thanks.\n[\n]\nBimmons: I guess its not true then.\nWattman: What isnt true?\nBimmons: That if you mess with J.J. Wattman, you have problems.\nWattman: I said that when I played football.\nBimmons: Yeah, but those are still YOUR teammates. You used to give a shit about them. Theyre in trouble.\n[\n]\nBimmons: Thanks for your time. I guess Im flying to New England.\n[\nWattman: Wait.\n... And were off! \n, coming in October 2015!!!!!\nBS: Come on! I just created an action movie for J.J. Watt! Cant I just ride this high for three more minutes???\n\n\nBS: Yup, you only have three more weeks to top Jeff from Lakelands Trestman rant as the \"Most Scathing Email Under 150 Words From a Disgruntled NFL Fan.\" The only way that email would have been funnier would be if Trestman had written a book in 2010 called \n. Wait, what???\n\nYeah, Im backing the Titans even though I am about to ask you the following question: Is Ken Whisenhunt the worst coach of the last 30 years to make a Super Bowl? Lets cross off every Super Bowl winner (yeah, even you, Barry Switzer) and everyone with a career record over .500 (a group that includes Bobby Ross, Lovie Smith and Jim Fassel). That leaves us with the following candidates.\n* \n Benched a red-hot Steve Grogan for a coming-off-injury Tony Eason right before Super Bowl XX, which was the first time I learned to use the word \"inexplicable\" correctly. Two years later, he started a now-petrified Eason, a washed-up Grogan and someone named Tom Ramsey over hometown hero Doug Flutie. By the 89 season, my dad and I had a running joke that Berry had passed away and the Patriots were propping up his corpse during games. When they finally fired him, the Pats replaced him with Rod Rust -- who actually WAS dead. You can look it up. The 1990 Patriots were coached by a dead body. But Berry finished with a career record of 48-39, so unfortunately we have to cross him off. Ill be honest -- I just felt like bitching about Raymond Berry.\n* \n 84-107 career record and averaged 5.2 wins over his last five seasons ... BUT he came very close to beating Montana and Walsh in Super Bowl XXIII, and he delivered one of the greatest in-stadium speeches ever. This speech is almost as good as J.J. Watts \"Micd Up\" video. Has there ever been a better dis of an opposing city? I have to cross him off.\n* \n Career record of 15-17. Took over Jon Grudens Raiders, went 11-5 and got thrashed by Grudens Bucs in the Super Bowl. The following year, he finished 4-12 while fending off a near mutiny, with Charles Woodson publicly accusing Callahan of tanking the season to rebuild around younger players. Callahan landed at Nebraska and finished 27-22 over four disappointing seasons; \n eventually named him \"the worst coaching hire of the decade.\" He never coached another team, although he has reinvented himself as a valuable Cowboys assistant. In 2013, multiple Raiders (led by Tim Brown and Jerry Rice) accused Callahan of sabotaging their Super Bowl XXXVII chances by changing Oaklands game plan 48 hours before the game. \n! Needless to say, we are NOT crossing Callahan off.\n* \n Career record of 47-61. The good news: Whiz came within a phenomenal Roethlisberger-Holmes throw-and-catch of winning the title. The bad news: Hes dropped 21 of his last 24. He also ripped through an astonishing 10 starting QBs in the 58 games hes coached since Kurt Warner retired. Derek Anderson, Max Hall, John Skelton, Kevin Kolb, Ryan Lindley, Brian Hoyer, Jake Locker, Zach Mettenberger, Charlie Whitehurst and OH MY GOD MY EYES ARE BURNING!!!!\nStill, Callahan battled a near mutiny and multiple sabotage allegations -- I dont know how you top that one. He earns my current \"Worst Super Bowl Coach of the Past 30 Years\" vote, although you cant rule out Whisenhunt grabbing it before 2016. How can Whiz avoid that happening? Heres a word of advice about coaches and QBs from one of my favorite authors:\nQuarterbacks are not born, theyre developed. Without a coach to train him, and teach him the fundamentals and details in a dignified, organized manner -- and at the highest standard -- the quarterback cannot and will not succeed. No quarterback ever played at a high level without a demanding coach, and no coach ever became great without exceptional and consistent quarterback play. The two are completely intertwined.\nThe author of that passage? Yup ... Marc Trestman. Every Chicago Bears fan will now light himself on fire.\nBS: I created the Speed Limit Corollary in January 2007 -- namely, that NFL coaches start losing their fastball at age 55 because of the long hours, their advancing age and a bunch of other stuff (\n). Coughlin responded by winning two Super Bowls at ages 61 and 65. (The lesson, as always ... ) What if I tweaked it to the Jersey Speed Limit Corollary? Jerseys speed limit ranges from 55 to 65 depending on the stretch of highway. NFL coaches lose it somewhere between 55 and 65, depending on how much of an ageless cyborg they are. And Belichick is probably a special-exemption New Mexico Speed Limit -- he might be able to defy all logic and keep cranking until hes 75, a la Bruce Springsteen.\nSpeaking of Bruce: I just \n in which we tackled the new College Football Playoff system, the future of concussions and football, and the increasingly troubling question, \"If O.J. Simpson claimed that he suffered a slew of concussions during his NFL career and has been battling advanced CTE these last 30 years, then donated his brain to science after he died and that turned out to be true, would that single-handedly change the O.J. is a double murderer narrative and transform him into something of a victim?\" In the middle of that podcast, we discussed Mondays surreal World Aids concert in which Springsteen and Chris Martin filled in as U2s lead singer for an ailing Bono ... and it just wasnt that good.\nDid they pick the wrong songs? Have we been underrating Bono all along? Who would fare the best if we threw eight bands in a concert, then played Lead Singer Roulette and just swapped the lead singers around like it was a 1970s key party? I couldnt understand why this wasnt a bigger deal -- two of the 10 most famous singers (Springsteen and Martin) inadequately filling in for another one of the 10 most famous singers (Bono) of one of the five most famous bands. For instance, if LeBron James said, \"Im filling in for Kevin Durant on OKC tonight while hes hurt,\" THAT would be a big deal ... right? Wed want to see how LeBron fit in that role, and how he played off Durants teammates. But with Martin/Bruce moonlighting on U2, nobody REALLY cared. Chucks take is predictably interesting -- he believes that people dont care about rock music nearly as much anymore, which is why the Martin-Bruce-U2 thing came and went. Anyway, heres the podcast if you want to listen to us ramble.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kearE3oP2wU\n\nThe 8-3-1 Bengals lead every other AFC North team by 1.5 games and have become -170 favorites to win the division (hold on, big \"but\" coming ... ), BUT everything could easily fall apart in December: home for Pittsburgh, at Cleveland, home for Denver (Monday night), at Pittsburgh. Yikes. Im grabbing the points because its a Kitchen Sink Game for Pittsburgh and playoff manifesto rules apply, which means that the \"Which starting QB do you trust more?\" rule IS in play.\nFor the record, I dont trust Andy Dalton in big games for the following reasons ...\n* Hes Andy Dalton.\n* He hasnt single-handedly killed Cincy in a football game in more than a month.\n* Hes 21st in QBR, one spot below Ryan Fitzpatrick and two spots below Mike Glennon.\n* Hes one of only four current starting QBs who havent thrown more TDs than interceptions. Dalton: 13 and 13. Josh McCown: 7 and 9. Geno Smith: 7 and 11. Blake Bortles: 9 and 15.\n* Bengals safety George Iloka called this Steelers-Bengals game a \"\n.\" Do you trust Ben Roethlisberger in a double-chinstrap game ... or do you trust Andy Dalton?\n* Oh, and Im still getting Dalton emails like this one ...\n\n\nBS: Fantastic email. Heres how I feel right now:\nBS: True fact: The AFC North is 11-2-1 against the NFC South, 7-1 against the Jags/Titans/Raiders, 8-8 against each other ... and 3-7 against everyone else. Of that \"everyone else,\" six were potential playoff teams.\nWeek 5: New England 43, Cincinnati 17\nWeek 5: Indianapolis 20, Baltimore 13\nWeek 7: Indianapolis 27, Cincinnati 0\nWeek 8: Pittsburgh 51, Indianapolis 34\nWeek 13: San Diego 34, Baltimore 33\nWeek 13: Buffalo 26, Cleveland 10\nTranslation: Start getting excited to wager against the AFC North champ in Round 1. Seriously. Start tucking money away.\n\nTrue or false: The Rams are still alive to win the NFC West. TRUE! I didnt realize this until Will in Charlotte sent along what he called \"the craziest possible \n.\" As part of that scenario, the Rams win the NFC West. (Its worth a click ... even if the sight of New England missing the playoffs made me temporarily lose vision in my right eye.) And no, I dont think the Rams are making the playoffs, but theyre definitely close to locking down the almost-as-coveted \"Friskiest Non-Playoff Team Of November/December\" honors.\nBS: I turned my response over to my buddy Joe House, a longtime fan/sufferer of the Washington Professional Football Team. Heres what he wrote back ...\nAs much as I enjoy a good Shanahan bashing -- because, honestly, what a pompous dick -- I dont think its accurate to pin the RGIII disaster on him. The true culprit -- as with all things pertaining to the Deadskins -- is the owner and the diseased, hyper-dysfunctional zombie-institution he has unfairly and cynically foisted upon the good people of the DMV. Absolutely fair to bust Shanahan for not taking a forceful stand in the 2012 playoff game -- hes the Coach, and in that moment, Cousins-for-Griffin was his call to make. But that mistake belongs to everyone in the organization, including Dr. James Andrews, who was standing on the sideline for that game.\nFrom that moment forward, though -- every single dumb misstep belongs to the dingbat owner, his crew of yes-men and Robert himself (who is all of 24 yrs. old now). The rush back to be ready for the 2013 season, the insistence on slogging through the 2013 games obviously limited in mobility and effectiveness and that seasons ultimate failure all belong to the guy upstairs. We know this because Shanahan carped and undermined and sabotaged via careful anonymous leaks the idea that RGIII was his 2013 QB choice. Lastly -- and this will be the last time I ever do anything that looks like a defense of Shanahan -- you have to give him and his son some credit for the wild success RGIII enjoyed in the 2012 regular season. Those dudes had the wisdom and foresight to install an offense consisting of sets and packages just like what RGIII ran at Baylor, and boy were the results impressive. Of course, it all went to hell because this is Snyder and the Deadskins and karma is a bitch.\n(Ladies and gentlemen, Daniel Snyders Washington Professional Football Team!)\n\n\n\n\nBS: They covered, so you made it anyway. The least-popular Pigskin PickEm picks are 6-0 against the spread since Week 13? Noted! As of noon ET on Friday, Week 14s least-popular picks are Jacksonville (14 percent) and Cleveland (16 percent)? Noted! Throw in home dogs being 7-1 over the past two weeks and I cant resist -- even if it means taking a mediocre team against Andrew the Giant and backing Blake Bortles against J.J. Watt. (GULP.) More important, did you know theres a \n? Do you want to have the \"Was the road recently closed three weeks for repairs?\" joke, or can I take it?\nBS: (Cackling like J.J. Watts coach after a J.J. Watt sack.)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7E9KtIbNaI\nBS: Im going the other way: I think Hoyer comes through this weekend; the Browns pull off the upset over an overrated Colts team that cant run the ball, turns the ball over too much and cant beat good teams; Andrew Sharp looks like a genius for \n; and then Cleveland beats Cincy at home in Week 15 before blowing Week 16s \"easy\" road game in Carolina. Whats the point? Because it feels like were heading toward the 9-6 Browns traveling to Baltimore for Week 17s win-or-go-home showdown against the Used-To-Be-The-Browns ... a.k.a. the God Hates Cleveland Bowl.\n\n\nBS: Boom Goes No Dynamite? Boom Boxed? Boom and No Room? Boom and Gloom? In all seriousness, you know that Ray Rice isnt playing in 2014 when even the impotent Colts -- a team owned by Jim Irsay (!!!!) -- wont go near him.\n\nSo Haloti Ngata gets nailed with a four-game PED suspension right as the Ravens are preparing for a \"Loser Leaves Town\" match in Miami? Sing it, Boy George!\nBS: \n, the NFLs revised PED policy allows the league to \"publicly disclose information relating to the discipline of a Player to correct inaccurate public claims made by that Player or his representatives about the discipline.\" In other words, Roger Goodell can legally call someone out for being a liar. OHHHHHHHH THE IRONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nBS: Hes not kidding. Here, look.\nSo did \n intentionally pit Goodell against the CDC guy as one of those read-between-the-lines gimmicks? The only way Id believe that would be if \ns website published a hit piece on Goodell from a former NFL player headlined, \"How on Earth Is Roger Goodell Still the Commissioner of the NFL?\" \n.\nBS: As someone who threw Baltimore into 35 different parlays and teasers last week, then watched Phil Rivers repeatedly grab my gambling winnings out of my pocket, all I have to say is ...\n(And yet, I cant write off the Ravens yet! What the hell is wrong with me? But seriously -- is Ryan Tannehill going to throw for 400 yards on the Ravens? I just dont see it.)\n\n\"Hello, everyone, Im Chris Myers ... \"\n\n\nBS: Come on! The Vikes are slowly climbing back to semisortamayberespectability. Theyre 0-4 against the Pats/Packers/Lions and 5-3 against everyone else. Theyre 3-3 since Week 7; those three losses came by 12 points combined. Mike Zimmer looks like a real coach. Teddy Bridgewater looks like the best 2014 rookie QB. And theyre about to get two first-rounders and nine second-rounders from Jerry Jones for Adrian Peterson after the Cowboys somehow miss the playoffs. Im buying Vikings stock. And by the way ...\nBS: As always, it could be worse: You could be rooting for the Jets!\nBS: I know, I know, this story seems too incredible even for Roger Goodell. But it happened. \n after the fact.\nFour years later, was John Mara \"selected\" as one of the two owners to \"lead\" the \"independent\" committee thats \"investigating\" how Goodell and the NFL bungled the Ray Rice scandal? Of course! Was Goodells buddy Dan Rooney -- the man who once happily delivered Goodell the news that \n -- the other owner \"selected\" to \"lead\" the \"independent\" committee? Absolutely! Do the Rooney family and Mara family have a special relationship that was once commemorated in \n that includes a photo of Goodell standing next to both Rooneys? You betcha!\nIf you missed it, heres my podcast with Van Natta from Tuesday. We dissected Goodells rocky tenure as commissioner as well as the timeline of the Rice scandal, almost as if we were recording an episode of \n. If youre on the fence about Goodells commissioner reign and you enjoy hearing the facts and only the facts from myself and a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter, Id encourage you to listen to our podcast.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAMoOm5u8zE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBS: And yet, the Lions are one game behind the Packers for the NFC North title! With only home games against Tampa and Minnesota and road games at Chicago and Green Bay on their schedule! It just looks too easy, so Im grabbing the points with a Bucs team thats 1-7 in either/or games. They are BUILT to go into Detroit as 10-point underdogs and lose by three. Thats what they do.\n\nI just thought about it some more -- theres no way I can pick Blake Bortles over J.J. Watt. You mess with J.J. Watt, you got problems. I dont want to mess with J.J. Watt by using Blake Bortles as my proxy. I cant. I just cant.\nBS: Blake Bortles looks like Pete Sampras. And I mean, Pete Sampras right now.\nBS: Everyone but the Colts, Packers, Seahawks, Patriots, Broncos and Jets.\nBS: Im all in. The Werewolves of London! Imagine how cool the helmets would look. Could one of you lovable/artistic/talented weirdos out there design mock helmets and mock uniforms for the London Werewolves? By the way, I was kidding about the Jets NOT trading their starting QB for J.J. Watt. Just wanted to see if the Jets fans were reading carefully. (Thinking.) Youre right, that was cruel. I apologize.\nBS: Are you crazy? Its definitely Peyton Manning. The dude just came back from four neck surgeries! Hes indestructable! Also, hes great at ordering people around, he loves coming up with complicated strategies, hed do anything to win, and hes unbelievable in every regular season. Thats the thing about the zombie apocalypse. Theres no playoffs. You just survive day after day after day. As long as nobody ever said, \"We only have to win one battle with the zombies and well end the apocalypse, but we HAVE to win this battle,\" wed be in perfect hands with Peyton Manning. My second choice: Ben Roethlisberger. Finishing last: Jay Cutler.\n\nYou cant give Kyle Orton this many points in Mile High!!!! Youre right, you totally can. But I like the way Buffalos defense is playing. Fact: Only one 2014 team has scored more than 23 points on them. Fact: Theyve given up 91 points since Week 6. Fact: Theyre third in defensive DVOA and fourth in special teams DVOA. Really, theyre a better version of the Rams defense/special teams that gave Denver so much trouble in Week 11. Also, Im a gigantic Patriots homer who loves rooting against the Mannings. So Im grabbing the points.\nBS: Every time I think weve found the perfect YouTube clip to illustrate the complete and total lack of self-awareness of the mid-1980s, something trumps it. Move over, Phil Simmss football aerobics video, theres a new sheriff in town! STAND BACK, PHIL SIMMS!\n\nCongrats to Arizona for bouncing back and forth between \"Nobody Believes In Us\" status and \"Everyone Believes In Us\" status a whopping five times (and counting). This week, Vegas made them a home dog against the 7-5 Chiefs even though the Cardinals are undefeated at home.\n(Do I even need to say it? Nahhhhh ... I dont even need to say it.)\n\n\nBS: Thats it. Hey, Cardinals: NOBODY BELIEVES IN YOU!!!!!!!!!\nBS: All depends on your concept of \"Least Valuable.\" The Jets wouldnt have made the 2014 playoffs even if theyd had a decent QB, and the Jaguars wouldnt have made the playoffs even if theyd had a decent offensive line. But the Chiefs might have the worst receiving crew of any 21st-century team that finished over .500. They dont have a single receiver with 600 receiving yards, and they dont have a single receiver with a touchdown catch. Given the last 10 years of pass-friendly rule changes, thats impossible -- it would be like NBC running \n with actors mangling English accents and NOT getting mocked on Twitter. So I have to give the 2014 LVU Award to K.C.s pathetic receivers.\n(Now watch them explode for 250 yards and four TDs against Arizona to ruin my pick.)\n\n\nBS: Did you know they keep track of this stuff? Andy \n, an above-average number that inspired \n about his flag-throwing competency. So as much as I love poking fun at Andy, we cant do it here. The best in the league? Mike Tomlin \n, which makes much more sense when you remember that the role of Mike Tomlin is always being played by \n star Omar Epps. Our worst flag thrower? Denvers John Fox ... only 41 wins in 111 challenges! That makes John Fox the John Fox of challenge flags. Andy Reid is just the Andy Reid of being Andy Reid.\n\n\nBS: You missed it. I just snuck by him. Im hiding in the second-to-last row wearing a hat and sunglasses. And by the way, I cant believe that I forgot the NFL season doesnt \n start until the weekend before Thanksgiving. My bad, Seattle. (No, Im not apologizing to you, San Diego.)\nBS: By turning into an arrogant, us-against-them asshole! I lost my mind as a football fan for about six years. (\n that I wrote after the Pats-Colts playoff game if you dont believe me.) Then the Helmet Catch happened. The rest was history, even if the arrogant asshole side did seep out a little bit after I saw that Packers-Patriots line. (And look how that turned out.) My advice: Stay humble, stay self-deprecating, always sound like you dont know what to believe about your team even if, deep down, you kind of do.\n\n\nBS: It took two people to write that email! Its hard to imagine San Francisco getting more than a second-rounder when everyone knows hes leaving. At the same time, the Niners might be able to play the Jets and Raiders against each other. And the Raiders once gave up a first-rounder and a second-rounder for Carson Palmer. So who knows? My best bet: The Raiders give up a 2016 first-rounder for Harbaugh, make him the coach and GM, sign him to a five-year, $35 million deal, then move 2015 operations to Los Angeles and suddenly Jim Harbaugh is running the Los Angeles Raiders. Im in for season tickets, by the way. Just charge my credit card now.\nBS: Lets just say that a few Packers fans emailed me about this. Which fan base remains the most bitter about a single blown NFL call? Oh wait, I forgot.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDQAmuZ8t94\n\nI tweeted this question earlier in the week, and Ill ask it again here: Who took the Bieber-Gronk photo, Bernard Karmell Pollard? MY GOD! Look at this thing!\nBS: Belichick couldnt keep Gronk away from Bieber for 20 seconds; now hes going to save the world? We need to bring in Eric from NYC just to cleanse the column of that appalling photographic karma.\nBS: Confession time: We planned on posting last weeks column on Wednesday, two days early, before Eric in NYC had sent along his weekly email. Late on Tuesday night, I emailed him asking for the photo early; he woke up Wednesday morning and hurriedly sent it along. Four days later, the Patriots lost. Heres the point: I blew the game by directly contacting Eric in NYC. It was my fault. Dont blame Rob Ninkovich for repeatedly getting beaten on the wheel route, dont blame Darrelle Revis and Devin McCourty for screwing up that Jordy Nelson touchdown before the end of the first half, and dont blame Tom Brady for being 80 percent as good as Aaron Rodgers that day and making a poor throw when he had Gronk one-on-one against a freaking rookie on the single biggest play of the freaking game (!?!?!?!?!?!?). Blame me. I broke the rules. It wont happen again. (And yes, Eric in NYC emailed me on his own this week.)\n\n\nBS: One of the best? My new goal in life is to see Bill Belichick testify as a witness in any kind of trial. Id absolutely pay $99.95 on pay-per-view for this. It would be like Cruise putting Jessup on the stand, only if Jessup never snapped at the end.\nBS: Thats it! You pushed me over the edge! I am officially changing my pick. Not only will the Chargers keep winning in 2014, theyre upsetting my Patriots this week: Chargers 37, Pats 34. You want a war, Chargers fans? Ill give you a war you wont believe! ENJOY THE SIMMONS STINK! My new pick ...\n\n\nBS: So if youre scoring at home, Im backing Rickarrie Grimathison and the 2014 \n Chargers over New England plus-four.\n\n\n\n\nBS: And guess what. You guys can enjoy the Simmons Stink, too."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/daniel-snyder-washington-redskins/", "blog_text": "Donald Sterlings imaginary \"Worst American Professional Sports Owner\" championship belt always blended perfectly with his all-black outfits and protruding belly. He inherited the title from outgoing Cavaliers owner Ted Stepien in 1983, then defended that WAPSO belt more times than Ric Flair defended the NWA belt. Sure, Sterling would occasionally get pinned by the likes of George Shinn, Marge Schott, John Spano and Al Davis, just like Flair got pinned by Kerry Von Erich and Sting. But the Notorious DTS never lost his belt for too long.\nHis WAPSO reign peaked with \n that named the Clippers \"The Worst Franchise in Sports History.\"\n For the rest of the decade, Sterlings team lived up to that lofty dishonor. Clippers fans thought they were never getting rid of him. They thought he might live to 125. Like a vampire or a turtle. Their luck flipped with 2009s Blake Griffin lottery, then again with 2011s Chris Paul trade veto. Doc Rivers showed up. V. Stiviano started recording stuff. TMZ started sniffing around. Sterling became a public pariah on par with O.J. Simpson and gluten. And before we knew it, the WAPSO title was vacant. Clippers fans were finally free.\nSo thats the good news for D.C. football fans. There \n hope. Sure, it might take 30-35 years, and you might break your own jaw from punching yourself in the face. But abominable sports owners cant own teams forever. Maybe theyll break the law, commit a catastrophic PR blunder, blow their money or drop dead. Maybe theyll get humiliated and sell. Maybe theyll lose their franchise because their surgically enhanced mistress/assistant surreptitiously recorded them saying insane things for 930 straight hours. But at some point, its ending.\nThe bad news for D.C. football fans? Daniel Snyder inherited Sterlings WAPSO belt and mounted an unexpectedly spirited title defense. Its difficult to separate Snyders inherent unlikability from everything else thats happening here. He carries himself like the sneaky kid in every boarding school drama who pretends to be buddies with everyone else, only when the gang gets in trouble, hes the first person to flip. (Think Cameron in \n or Jack Wheeler in \n.) But there have been plenty of unlikable owners; when youre unlikable AND youre destroying a beloved franchise, thats different.\nI happen to know a few Washington fans, including my buddy House, and their collective dread for the future matches any Sterling-era Clippers fan. The crucial difference: Clippers fans had always been trapped in coach in a middle seat; they never knew what first class felt like. The Washington Professional Football Team used to give its fans a first-class football experience. That franchise \n. It won multiple Super Bowls. It had a famous stadium and famous coaches and famous stars. It resonated more in the extended D.C. area than every other pro team combined.\nOver the past 10 years, Snyders football team transformed into the black sheep of the D.C. sports scene and a general laughingstock. Washingtons football team was fine until Daniel Snyder showed up. House derisively calls them \"the Deadskins\" these days. And he means it.\nIf you asked me in 1999 to name the five most important NFL franchises, I would have defined \"important\" by some admittedly murky formula that included long-term success, a storied history, the recognizability of its uniform/logo/name, the breadth/passion/support of a multi-generation fan base and its weight/power/influence compared to the other local teams in its city. And I would have given the following answer: Green Bay, Dallas, Pittsburgh, Washington and the New York Giants.\nMention that list to a Washington fan 15 years later and you can almost see the blood leaving their body. For the first time in franchise history, theyre thinking entirely in question marks. \n In general, fans are loyal as hell. We root for laundry and we know it -- we dont care. Its part of our DNA. Were always coming back. Its just one of the things that makes human beings so freaking strange. Well divorce \n before we divorce our favorite teams.\nBut an irredeemable owner? Thats the only person who can nudge a fan base to a collective breaking point. When you support a pro team with an unspeakably awful owner, at some point you take a step back, do the math and mutter things like, \"I was 19 when he bought the team, Im 34 right now, and Im gonna be 54 in 2034 -- AND WE ARE STILL GOING TO SUCK BECAUSE THIS GUY F- - - - - -  SUCKS AND HES NEVER LEAVING AND WHAT THE HELL AM I GOING TO DO?\"\nAnytime a sports franchise goes into an unexpected death spiral, I start getting emails from that teams traumatized fans, as well as everyone else fascinated by such an obviously depressing situation. In general, those emails veer toward one of six mailbag angles.\nSince Snyder joined the NFL in May 1999, the D.C. football team has two playoff wins, four playoff appearances and four finishes over .500: 1999 (10-6), 2005 (10-6), 2007 (9-7) and 2012 (10-6). During that 16-season stretch, Snyder employed a whopping eight head coaches (only one fewer than the rest of the NFC East combined over that period) and \n. His career record is 107-146, which will probably become \n by the end of December. Also, he chopped down a bunch of trees on the Potomac, \n and earned himself the nickname \n And did lots and lots of other unlikable stuff. By November 2010, Snyder had generated so many football and non-football stories ranging from \"incredibly misguided\" to \"indefensible\" to \"inexplicably hateful\" to \"almost definitely illegal\" to \"just plain unbelievable\" that \n thats longer than your average Simmons column.\nDid Snyder sue McKennas paper? Of course he did! Was the lawsuit dropped? Of course it was! The man has accumulated four more years of crazy craziness since then.\n No, you dont need to send me that laundry list of Snyder horrors anymore. And yes, I am always paying attention when the WAPSO belt is in play.\nTwo solid email examples here ...\n \"As a non-Skins fan living outside DC, I hope Snyder never sells. I love turning on the radio every monday morning and listening to everyone talk about how embarrassing the team is, and how terribly they lost, all while managing to blame anything and everything except the Snyder himself (on a radio station that, surprise, SNYDER OWNS HIMSELF!). Nothing makes the start of my week better than the unintentional comedy that is the Washington Native American Slurs.\"\nQuick tangent: Im running that same schadenfreude playbook with the 2014-15 Train Wreck Lakers. I watch their 24-hour TV channel and listen to local sports radio more than usual, just because its so delightful (at least for me) to hear anyone discuss my least-favorite NBA team that hopelessly. Shit, \n partly to attend the annual Lakers-at-Celtics game just in case it became a Boston blowout. (And it was!) Lakers fans dont take this personally because, if the roles were reversed, theyd be doing the same. Delighting in the misfortune of a bitter rival isnt bad karma, its just what fans do. As for the flip side ...\n \"My guilty pleasure: when St Louis sports teams win big games, I like going to newspaper sites for the losing teams to read bitter fan comments. This week, I went to the \n and read several stories about the Rams blowing out the Skins. Although there were a few whiners complaining about Fishers pregame trolling and the usual get rid of the coach posts, for the most part I started feeling really sorry for DC fans. Snyder has stolen their joy. Most comments were from fans remembering the glory days of the Hogs who now find themselves in constant pain as their team gets worse and worse. The only thing left for Redskins fans is a mercy killing. Remove that team, send it to LA and let those poor people get on with their lives.\"\nNow thats a bummer. Poor Bob wanted to feed his weekly hate-read ritual and stumbled into something much darker -- empathy. But the words \"Snyder has stolen their joy\" say it all. Hold on, its about to get darker.\nEspecially if the reader is standing a little too close to the flame, if you get my drift. Heres \n ...\n\"Is the Washington NFL team the worst, most dysfunctional franchise in professional sports? Washington is now a perennial loser. The teams name is considered by many to be racist. They have a meddling, litigious, unlikable owner, two decades of dysfunction, a clueless PR team and the worst home stadium experience. Even promising moments (RG3 2012) backfire spectacularly (RG3 2014). And theres no hope because Dan Snyder is only 50 and will never sell. If the NFL wasnt already a morally dubious venture, the embarrassment of following the Washington team has pushed me over the edge. Im officially an NFL widower. And I feel so much better; its amazing how many errands and how much yard work you can do with a full Sunday. The Washington NFL Franchise is the suckiest franchise in professional sports. Thank God I can still get by watching crushing playoff collapses by the Nats and Caps!\"\nThat one nailed a variety of checkmarks: mild hyperbole (words like \"worst\" and \"suckiest\"), some slight homerism (by rule, shouldnt the Raiders be mentioned in any \"worst/most dysfunctional\" discussion?), the mini laundry list of tragedies (always a staple), the surprising reveal in the middle (he buried the lede -- he actually made himself an NFL widower!), the obligatory poison arrow at someone (calling the NFL \"morally dubious,\" which I thoroughly enjoyed) and a terrific sarcastic closer that would have made Joe House proud.\nThe most poignant line in that email: \"Theres no hope because Dan Snyder is only 50 and will never sell.\" Hold that thought.\nI dont get enough of these. \n made it short and sweet ...\n\"Simmons -- everyone here is ripping Chainsaw Dan as you probably know from House. What would a short defense of Chainsaw Dan look like? Can a short defense of Chainsaw Dan even be possible? What would such a defense look like?\"\nExcellent! I like this game because Sterlings quickie defense would have looked like this:\n* At least he comes to the home games.\n(And were done!)\nYou could stretch a quickie Snyder defense to 12 parts if you wanted. By the way, I had to take a shower before I wrote the next 12 paragraphs. Remember to say, \"Say what you want about Snyder, but ... \" before each of them.\nSay what you want about Snyder, but ...\n At least he grew up in Maryland and at least hes a real fan of the team.\n At least he spends money! Sure, he spends it stupidly, but wouldnt you rather have a lavishly incompetent owner than a cheapskate owner? You can learn to be smarter. You cant learn NOT to be cheap.\n Even though he owns the team radio station, and maybe it feels like something that would happen in Russia, its not like they sing his praises 24/7, right? Daniel Snyder kinda sorta almost supports free speech!\n How bad can Snyder be if none of his fired employees ever says anything bad about him? Wait, they probably all signed a nondisclosure agreement? (Thinking.) Still, Daniel Snyders fired employees never say anything bad about him!\n Hes a smart businessman. He didnt inherit his NFL team from his dad like so many other owner buffoons. Do you know who became the youngest CEO in the New York Stock Exchange back in 1996? Daniel Marc Snyder, thats who. He didnt inherit his money -- he made his money.\n Unlike many owners, hes not afraid to take big swings. The RG3 trade? Haynesworth? Big money for Gibbs and Shanahan? DANIEL SNYDER TAKES BIG SWINGS!\n We all know Shanahan ruined Griffin -- not Snyder. Its Shanahans fault that Griffin ripped up his knee.\n Hes the only guy crazy enough to defend the teams name -- theyre the Redskins, thats their name, and thats who they are. A football team with a name thats a slur that offends Native Americans, but still. Thats who they are!\n Hes one of Roger Goodells favorite owners -- and as weve learned unequivocally over the years, Roger Goodells buddies get treated more favorably than other owners. Advantage, Washington!\n His company owns the Johnny Rockets franchise. That means Daniel Snyder likes cheeseburgers and milkshakes -- whats more American than that?\n At least he admits his mistakes. Everyone keeps pointing to the eight coaches hes had -- why cant that be a positive? Some owners stick with the wrong coach for an extra year or two to save money. Not Snyder. DANIEL SNYDER CLEANS UP HIS OWN MESS!\n At least he comes to the home games.\n(Hold on, I need to take another shower. Ill be right back.)\nSome reader emails make me wonder if I have a higher calling: the Sports Whisperer. Am I the Cesar Millan for emotionally destroyed sports fans? Heres a good example from \n ...\n\"The Skins won their three Super Bowls when I was 4, 9, and 13 years old. Success during your childhood makes most people pretty loyal. But Im 36 now -- I cant go on rooting for a team led by the totally unlikable Danny Boy, with a racist mascot (its insensitive at minimum) and two decades of losing and incompetence. I want out. But Im very conflicted on becoming a fan of another team. Do I have to become an NFL widower until Chainsaw Dan sells the team, which might be after Im dead? Are there rules and regulations in place somewhere that I can follow to switch allegiances to another team? Should I become an NFL agnostic and just root for my college alma mater instead? This is a job for 2006 Bill Simmons, I know, but maybe you could help out anyway?\"\nWhat a backhanded compliment! It was actually a job for 2002 Bill Simmons in my \"\n\" column, in which I laid out a series of rules for fan behavior. Its a funny reread because I eventually broke some of these rules -- most flagrantly, the concept of a \"five-year grace period\" (for instance, Im furious at the 2013 MLB champs for botching the Jon Lester thing -- \n) and \"Just because you supported a team that won a championship, it doesnt give you the right to turn into a pompous, insufferable schmuck\" (whoops). I stand by much of what I wrote about fan-team divorces, but dont feel nearly as strongly about this part:\nThe \"pick someone else\" part just doesnt work. I drifted back to the Bruins after the strike season, although it has never really been the same. In 2011, I bought Kings season tickets just because I liked watching hockey -- three-plus seasons and two Cups later, both of my kids absolutely LOVE the Kings. When youre a parent, you root for anything that makes your kids happy. So, yeah, I rooted for the Kings as long as they werent playing the Bruins. Everything peaked when the three of us were sitting together, right behind the winning net, when Alec Martinez scored his double-OT Cup clincher. Just an unbelievable parent-kid bonding experience; Ive never seen them happier.\nDid I inadvertently become a sports bigamist? Did I waver when the Bruins came to L.A. to play the Kings last week? Please. I could never, ever root against a Boston team. DNA is DNA. And it turned out to be a fun night -- my kids and I taunted each other for three periods, the Kings won by two goals, my kids taunted me some more, and then I told them to fuck off, left them in Staples Center and drove home alone.\nHeres why I bring this up: Its nearly impossible to just \n teams. Again, your DNA is your DNA. But divorcing them and never remarrying? Thats more doable. Football is the easiest \"divorce sport\" -- become an NFL widow, step up your gambling and fantasy football, then you have multiple \"favorite\" teams and players every weekend. You couldnt do that with any other sport. You dont necessarily need a favorite NFL team.\nThen again, if you played it that way, youd miss out on stuff that transcends winning and losing. Loving a pro sports team isnt just about watching games, going to the ballpark or stadium, wearing the hats and jerseys and having something to do. Its about history, generations, connections, family, friends, loyalty and memories. Its about euphoria and pain and everything in between. Its about \n caring about something. Its about being a small part of something thats greater than you. You dont just walk away from that stuff without putting real thought into it.\nSnyder pushed many Washington football fans to that specific point; maybe thats not a unique achievement. But reaching Mailbag Angle No. 6? Now THAT is an achievement.\nCheck out this seemingly ludicrous email from \n ...\n\"Wouldnt any rational Skins fan support Dan Snyder moving the team to LA, so long as the NFL promised DC an expansion team within three years -- like what happened with the Browns and Ravens in 1996? I would gladly go without an NFL team for three years, then deal with a replacement level expansion squad for another few years, just to get Snyder out. Has there ever been another NFL team so dysfunctional that it causes its fans to daydream about their own team leaving town?\"\nGreat question. I have some personal experience here. Patriots fans hit rock bottom just a few years after the 85 Bears crushed us. We finished 5-11 in 1989 and 1-15 in 1990, endured a hateful sexual harassment locker-room scandal, traded down in two straight drafts and improbably turned the no. 3 and no. 1 overall picks into \n, \n. The 1990 Pats actually caused me to start gambling just to stay interested in football. (In other words, thank you, 1990 Pats!) At some point, our idiot bankrupt owner (Victor Kiam) sold the team to a St. Louis billionaire (James Orthwein) who claimed he didnt want to move the Patriots even though everyone knew he did. Me and every other Patriots fan were 95 percent mortified (\"Theyre trying to steal our team!\") and 5 percent hoping they were stolen away. \n When Orthwein hired Bill Parcells, that 5 percent vanished. Robert Kraft saved the Patriots and the rest was history.\nAnyway, thats rock bottom. Thats the lowest you can sink -- when you say to yourself, \"Id rather have the non-guaranteed chance at a real football franchise than the guaranteed reality of THIS football franchise.\" I never realized Washington fans had reached that point until Paul Fischer sent me that email. I mentioned it to my Washington-fan friends. \n Everyone said yes. I couldnt believe it. House even offered to drive everyone to the airport.\nJust to be sure, I called the \ns Dan Steinberg, an excellent writer with an exceedingly rational feel for the Washington sports scene. He thought 75 percent of Washington fans would take the deal, as long as the new expansion team \n. Steinberg believes that Snyders age is the single most important X factor for Washington fans. Hes only 50 years old. What if he never sells? What if he owns the Skins until 2050? What then? What do you do?\n\"I mean, he might outlive House,\" Steinberg said.\nIf youve ever watched an episode of \"\n,\" you know thats probably a safe bet. But this Snyder saga seems bleaker than bleak. Hopeless, even.\nThats why it makes me so happy to pass along two pieces of advice. First, Snyders early business success duped him into thinking he could thrive in football. He was wrong. But hes a terrible owner for \n reasons. He spends money, just usually on the wrong things. He takes chances, but theyre usually the wrong chances. He comes off as pompous and stubborn and willfully unlikable, but those traits arent exclusive to him. His biggest flaw? Hes absolutely dreadful at hiring people.\nYou could have made a similarly harsh case for Robert Sarver, who blew Phoenixs chance to win a title during Steve Nashs prime with a variety of boners. Sarver was the NBAs worst non-Sterling owner as recently as two years ago. Guess what happened? \n He spent a little more money and delegated to smarter basketball people. Crazy people cant get better. Unqualified people cant get better. But a self-aware, intelligent businessman CAN learn from his mistakes. It happened with Sarver and it has happened with others. For all we know, it could still happen with Snyder. Its not impossible.\nSecond, if things dont improve by the end of this decade, I cant imagine Snyder keeping his football team. Unlike James Dolan or Hal Steinbrenner or Jimmy Buss, hes not some bumbling rich kid who inherited his breaks and stubbornly kept his team because he didnt want to seem like a failure. Unlike Al Davis and Marge Schott, you couldnt describe him as \"increasingly deranged\" or \"flat-out racist.\" Unlike Paul Brown or [fill in 30 other owners], hes not willfully frugal. Unlike Donald Sterling, he doesnt lack self-awareness, sanity, decorum or the very basic levels of human compassion and decency.\nSnyder grew up in Maryland and achieved a lifelong dream of owning his hometown team. Unless hes a truly reprehensible human being with no redeeming qualities, I sincerely doubt that Snyder wants to be remembered forever as the local kid who stubbornly destroyed Washingtons once-great football franchise. I think he makes excuses to himself. \n That kind of stuff. Right now, hes probably blaming Jay Gruden (for killing RG3s confidence) and Bruce Allen (for assembling this lousy roster). Someday, hes going to look in the mirror. And that will be that.\nBut thats in the future. Right now, hes our undisputed 2014 WAPSO champ. If Washington fans really want to dump Daniel Snyder from their lives, they should continue crushing him on message boards and radio stations. They should start boycotting home games and/or selling their season tickets to fans from visiting teams. They should stop buying team merchandise and throw their support behind the Nats, Caps and Wiz. They should organize \"SNYDER MUST GO\" rallies before home games.\nOr, they could take David Changs advice and raise billions to purchase the team themselves. Last December, Chang tweeted that he wanted to raise $6 billion on Kickstarter to make Snyder something of a \n offer. That brainstorm briefly became a big deal in Washington -- after all, Chang is a local kid and an accomplished restaurateur, as well as a lifelong fan of the now-Deadskins. Chang eventually found out that Kickstarters rules wouldnt allow that plan, but it didnt stop him from wondering aloud if Washington fans could mobilize.\n\"If we could get ownership like the Green Bay Packers, think about how awesome that would be?\" \n. \"Dans young. Hell probably own the team for the next 30 [years] at least, unless the fans do something.\"\nAnd thats the thing -- the fans \n do something. In 2014, its never been easier to mobilize socially or financially. Even if $6 billion seems ludicrously high, could someone like Chang slap together an ownership consortium for $2 billion, then use a Kickstarter-like device to raise another billion from frustrated fans? Or could a group of influential Washington fans organize and execute a genuinely savvy boycott plan? What if they crippled Snyders profit potential and embarrassed him -- legally and peacefully -- in a variety of clever ways? Wouldnt that be the ultimate revenge? What would be better than suffocating Snyders wallet, forcing Snyder out and saving football in Washington? They could become the first fan base to turn the tables on a historically atrocious sports owner. Its sitting there for them.\nAnd if Americas capital cant figure out how to organically dispose of Americas least redeeming professional sports owner? Then this country is in worse shape than I thought."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-week-15-nfl-picks/", "blog_text": "We split Fridays column into two parts.

And they ARE a Week 16 home victory over Seattle and a Week 17 road victory over the floundering 49ers away from NEVER LEAVING ARIZONA FOR THE ENTIRE PLAYOFFS. So why wouldnt you throw down $100 on the Cards at 20-to-1?\nBS: Oh wait, THAT is why the Cards are 20-1.

Please, find me the one football fan in America who has more confidence in Ryan Lindley than Tim Tebow. I want to meet this person.\n\nDear Sports Gods,\nI just need six more healthy games from Gronk. Six and only six. I think about this pretty much every hour of every day. Why couldnt he stay healthy?

He has thrown for 4,000 yards only four times, and he has topped 30 touchdown passes only once. Hes never come within 670 yards of a 5,000-yard season, and hes never thrown 33 TD passes. This season, hes on pace to come within a hair of 5,000 yards and throw 36 TDs ... and thats without including this Sundays \"Im playing Atlantas atrocious defense!!!\" bump.\nBS: My favorite one-game, non-Patriots, 2014 playoffs scenario is the Smith-Caldwell checkers championship in Round 1, narrowly edging Rodgers and the Packers traveling to Arizona to play Brett Favre and the Cardinals in the NFC title game.

Watt MVP Campaign +1.\n\n\nBS: Great point. Hes the real-life Waterboy. That would be an awesome nickname for J.J. Watt if his name werent already \"J.J. Watt.\"\nBS: I didnt miss the mark! Hollywood never comes up with the right title for an action movie; its always 30 percent off and it never totally achieves its potential. \n was the obvious pick. But Hollywood would have screwed it up and gone with \n. Here, \n in this recently hacked email exchange.\nRUDIN: Did you read the Simmons column? I liked his idea for the J.J.

But Jeremy stumbled into some ratings gold there -- who wouldnt watch Bill Belichick, fresh off winning his fourth Super Bowl, hosting \n a week later? The worst \n host would be Colin Kaepernick -- hed stink for the first 75 percent of the show, then mount a belated garbage-time drive in a good sketch after youd already turned it off.\n\nIts too much of an Aaron Rodgers love-fest right now. Even Grantlands Robert Mays, a die-hard Bears fan, did everything short of reenacting Scotty J.s \"Can I kiss you on the mouth?\" scene from\n when he discussed Rodgers in the office yesterday. I kept waiting for Mays to show us his Packers-green Corvette. Rodgers is turning the entire country to mush. Isnt he due to get banged around by an excellent defense in cold weather for four quarters, get sacked a few times, throw a tipped pick or two, maybe even fumble a shotgun snap? Or am I just overly threatened by him because I keep seeing Rodgers standing in the way of Tom Bradys fourth Lombardi Trophy? Could it be both? Can we agree its both?\nBS: I watched the whole game. Your defense played great considering referees sometimes treat Peyton Mannings team the same way the WWE treats Randy Ortons matches when Triple H is the special guest referee. Oh, and Aaron Rodgers is Seth Rollins. (So if you think last week was bad ... )\n\n\n\n\nBS: Im still backing Kansas Citys receivers. When youre running four-yard outs in a one-minute drill situation down by three in a must-win game, you know your receivers are an out-and-out travesty. Besides, Baltimores secondary might not come back to haunt the Ravens until Round 2! They finish the season with Blake Bortles, Ryan Fitzpatrick and Johnny Manziel -- none of those guys is torching them. If they win the AFC North, theyre hosting a no. 5 seed or a no. 6 seed in Round 1 -- thats either Phil Rivers (trouble), Ben Roethlisberger (trouble), Fitzpatrick, Tannehill, Kyle Orton, Andy Dalton, Alex Smith or Manziel. They have something like a 75 percent chance of NOT facing a playoff QB who might burn them.\nAnd then? Its Brady or Manning in Round 2 coupled with months and months of horrible karma from the Rice scandal that just keeps getting worse and worse when you read things like \n Play it, anguished Tori Amos disciple!\n\n\nBS: Dont worry -- everything will be fine when they become the London Werewolves in two years. \n from Jerry Hultsch.\n\n\nBS: Thats reason no. 547 why CBS needs to demote Simms next spring and replace him with Rex Ryan. Sports fans should be allowed to vote every year on secretly important things like \"Whos our no. 1 NFL color analyst for the three major networks?\" If that CBS vote were \"Rex or Simms,\" I think Rex carries 96.7 percent of the vote. But major networks and local cable networks are abjectly terrified of ever demoting a lead play-by-play or color announcer. Just watch NBA League Pass for one night. Its incredible. Why do we treat TV announcers and radio announcers like theyre tenured professors? GIVE US REX.\nBS: The tickets! This is a historic battle! Were about to see the Jets destroy their fans holiday season by stupidly winning this game and willingly removing themselves out of the \"Suck For The Duck\" and \"Shame Us For Jameis\" races. Whats a better in-person comedy experience -- seeing Chris Rock do stand-up or seeing the Jets win this game?\nBS: Again, can you put a price on this kind of sneaky-good excitement??? Oh wait, you totally can -- its $9.\nThe rest of Week 15s Sneaky-Good Watch: Jamie Collins; Buffalos D; Todd Bowless ballsy blitzes during two-minute drills; Sheldon Richardson and Elvis Dumervils DPOY candidacies in a world where J.J. Watt doesnt exist; every story about the dysfunctional Knicks; every wire story that tried to sum up the 631-page transcript of Ray Rices appeal that danced around the fact that Roger Goodell came off as either (a) completely and utterly incompetent, or (b) someone who unequivocally said multiple things that turned out not to be true; T.Y. Hiltons getwidefreakingopenability; Melvin Ingram; any play in which the Pats spread Gronk wide against a terrified CB; Brandon Browner, Old-School Enforcer; \n in \n; Phillys special teams from a historic standpoint (\n!); James Hardens MVP candidacy; Seattles D (last three games: 20 points, 507 yards allowed); \n on Starz (what a show!); \n; \n in general.\n\nAccording to \n, only Brian Hoyer (nine) and Andy Dalton (nine) have thrown more picks than Peyton Manning (eight) since Week 9. Also, this feels like a cross between a Kitchen Sink Game and a Phil Rivers Doing Phil Rivers Stuff Game for the Chargers ... and if youre the Broncos, do you REALLY need this game? Arent they locked into a no. 2 seed? OMAHA!!!!!!!\n\n\nBS: \n covered this on Twitter -- apparently doing both jobs wears down your legs and your body too much. At the same time, if I were a punter, it would piss me off that field goal kickers keep taking over for injured punters without ever imploding. Cant you see the other 31 starting punters watching Nick Novak taking his first punting snap last Sunday night and muttering, \"Shank this! SHANK THIS!\" And they never shank it. Theres no bigger disparity between \"Whoa, this is gonna be amazingly entertaining!\" and \"Wow, this isnt entertaining at all\" than the before/after moments when the backup punter becomes involved in an NFL game.\n\nMinnesota hasnt played a bad game since Week 6. And doesnt this \"Detroit is cruising into the playoffs\" thing look a little too easy? Its the Lions! Things never go easily for the Lions! At the very least, lets agree that you arent allowed to throw them into a two-team teaser.\nBS: I had to cross him off because hes nine games over .500 for his career (35-26). Believe me ... it hurt.\nBS: Looks like the perfect time to break out Week 15s Shakeys Pizza Watch: the thought of Philly or Arizona throwing the ball from behind in January; the Superdome Saints; the Brees-Payton era; SDs centers; Brandon Browner, Penalty Machine; \n as its coach (please, God, let it happen); the fact that coaches cant review helmet-to-helmet hits; Carolina going 64 days between wins but somehow having a chance to take over the NFC South this weekend; Keenan Allens body disappearing on Revis Island; RG3 unexpectedly turning into the MGMT of football (great debut album, and then the wheels came off); the \ns unfathomably \n; Goodells now-documented performance during the Rice appeal hearing; the fact that we have to carefully write headlines like \"Transcript shows inconsistencies in Goodells testimony on Rice matter.\"\n\nThey cant make that Seahawks line high enough. Kaepernick is a broken man -- even Mischa Barton didnt flame out this fast. We need to break up Kaep and Harbaugh.\nBS: I just told you -- we need to break up Kaep and Harbaugh. Besides, the Raiders should hire Roger Goodell as their next head coach. They could finish 2-14 for the next eight years as Goodell repeatedly contradicts himself; ignores game plans; glosses over player safety; pretends not to have evidence; writes letters to season ticket holders telling them something didnt happen when it actually did; keeps changing the teams personal conduct policy depending on how he feels on a given week; and gives one awkward press conference after another explaining that hes \"got to get this right\" and knows he \"needs to get better.\" And every once in awhile, the previous Raiders coach (Tony Sparano) could come back and fix one of his messes by giving a different ruling. I think this makes a ton of sense.\n\n\nBS: What about Harbaugh going to Michigan just a few weeks after there was so much action on a \"Harbaugh goes to Michigan bet\" that a gambling site actually had to \n? I vote for that! By the way, reread the M. Night Harbaughlan email from my \n. Its becoming increasingly amazing. Could that Michigan job be \n?\n\nJust feels like these forgettably above-average teams should split their season series. Its really that simple. And also ...\nBS: Why, thank you!\n\n\nBS: Its really, really, really, really hard NOT to root for this.\n\n\nBS: Good Lord, were in range.\nBS: Yup, these are my readers."}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/finding-the-cleveland-misery-tipping-point/", "blog_text": "Every time I mention in my football column that God hates Cleveland, fans from Buffalo, Minnesota, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Jacksonville, Carolina, Houston, San Diego, Tennessee, Arizona, Atlanta and Detroit take it personally. So do Jets fans under 45, Dolphins fans under 40, Bears fans under 35 and Washington fans under 30.\nTranslation: Around 50 percent of the NFLs fan base believe God might hold a grudge against their teams. And that number would climb to 75 percent if Patriots fans, Saints fans, Bucs fans, Seattle fans, Indy fans, St. Louis fans and Denver fans hadnt won Super Bowls in the past 15 years. Its just one of the ways we handle steady failure. Our favorite team cant come through, so higher forces must be in play, right? Not having a scientific way to measure which professional fan bases have been tortured the most didnt stop me from \n, then again \n. Astoundingly, three Cleveland teams cracked the top 10: the Browns (no. 4), the Indians (no. 5) and the Cavaliers (no. 10).\nThat was the moment when I realized that, yes, God might actually hate Cleveland. More evidence mounted over the last four years -- Brandon Weeden, Trent Richardson, Anthony Bennett, \n and, of course, \"The Decision\" -- until everything seemingly flipped in 2014, with LeBrons homecoming and a 6-3 Browns start. Of course, its Cleveland, so those feel-good vibes didnt last long. The elephant in the room: Did Cleveland remarry LeBron \n his basketball apex had passed? After playing a staggering 40,000 minutes (in just 11 seasons) and carrying four straight Finals teams, LeBron might be battling the long-term effects of a historically ridiculous two-way burden. Hes still great, but hes not GREAT. And hes not nearly as overpowering as he used to be. Jordan learned how to compensate for declining athleticism on his last two Bulls teams, so its not hopeless. But for the first time, we can see a finish line for LeBron James. You couldnt see it six months ago.\nAs for the Browns, their football season imploded after back-to-back home losses against Indianapolis (a mega-giveaway) and Cincy (an ass-kicking). In that Bengals game, Browns hero-in-waiting Johnny Football made his first start, threw two egregious picks, couldnt generate a single point and played about as confidently as a fan pulled out of the stands. As far as debuts go, Manziels first start ranks right up there with Carl Lewis \n.\nIf I were a Browns fan, Id spend the winter torturing myself about Door A of the 2014 draft (staying put, then taking Sammy Watkins and Teddy Bridgewater) or Door B (trading down once, then landing Odell Beckham Jr., Teddy Bridgewater and Buffalos 2015 no. 1), instead of what actually happened with Door C (trading twice to end up with Justin Gilbert, Manziel and Buffalos 2015 no. 1).\n If Manziel becomes a hellacious bust -- and its certainly in play -- then the poor Cleveland fans would add yet another \"What if?\" to their torture belt.\nTheir 2014 suffering didnt stop there -- after Roger Goodells \n cameo doubled as the longest and most inexplicable commissioner cameo in sports movie history, Goodells tenure spiraled into complete and utter disgrace. Even seemingly-but-not-really impartial commissioners arent immune to Clevelands stink! So, with the Factory of Sadness churning out its annual array of holiday tears and fears, I thought wed swing the collective karma. What if we identified the official \"God Hates Cleveland\" tipping point? You know, a specific moment in history that makes you say, \"Oh yeah, THAT was it! Thats when everything turned!\"\nIf we knew what that moment was and when it happened, could we perform a virtual sports exorcism? Lets find out! Put on one of those giant oxygen masks like were making crystal meth together, throw on a creepy protective raincoat, and wade through Clevelands recent sports history with me.\n Won the 1964 NFL championship, lost the 1965 championship game to Green Bay, then weathered Jim Browns unexpected retirement by going 71-38 from 1966 to 1973 -- a stretch that included five playoff appearances and two conference championship games. In 1980, the 11-5 Browns snapped a seven-year playoff drought and squandered a playoff heartbreaker to Oakland (the infamous Red Right 88 game). They made the playoffs six more times in the 1980s, somehow blowing three conference title games to Elways Broncos: 1986 (\n), 1987 (\n) and 1989 (Not The Drive Or The Fumble).\nBy the time that decade ended, Browns fans were about as fun to hang out with as the dad from \n By the way, The Fumble never gets enough credit for being completely devastating -- its unquestionably a no. 1 seed in any \"Most Devastating Stomach-Punch Losses Ever\" bracket.\n Good Lord. I will never forget watching this.\n Once the California Golden Seals, they relocated from Oakland to Cleveland in 1976 and lasted two forgettable years. And by forgettable, I mean everyone forgets that Cleveland ever had an NHL team. Oh, it happened! They merged with the Minnesota North Stars in June 1978, becoming your 36-years-and-counting answer to the trivia question \"What was the last NHL team to fold?\" Wait, heres a fun game:\nBarons (1976-78): 47-87-26\n\nBrowns (1999-2006): 40-88\n\nBrowns (2007-14): 44-82\nSo the Browns returned to the NFL in 1999, and since then, they have almost exactly the same winning percentage as Clevelands one hockey team that (a) folded after two years, and (b) left this one seemingly obscure hockey fight as its only real YouTube legacy? Amazing.\n Won the 1948 World Series, got swept in the 1954 World Series and didnt make the playoffs again until ... (searching \n) ... (still searching) ... wait, \n? Its true. They cratered somewhere between 1974 (the infamous \n) and 1989 (when Hollywood decided that Cleveland was the perfect downtrodden MLB franchise for \n). Although the Indians didnt hit rock-bottom until closer Jose Mesa couldnt protect a one-run lead in the 97 World Series, followed by this moment two innings later. Cover your eyes.\n Joined the NBA as an expansion team in 1970, then made the Eastern Finals five years later thanks to the Miracle of Richfield. Whats the Miracle of Richfield? Well, if you want to relive the days of balding white guys making series-winning layups, NBA fans rushing the floor and tearing down the basket, and Cleveland fans being generally euphoric, do I have the embedded YouTube clip for you.\nThe 76 Cavs lost to my beloved Celtics and finished the decade relatively unscathed. In 1980, new owner Ted Stepien quickly ran them into the ground like nothing weve ever seen -- to the point that the NBA instituted the \"\n\" AND gave Clevelands next owner compensatory draft picks just to minimize Stepiens damage. (\n last year. He made Donald Sterling look like Dr. Jerry Buss -- at least from a basketball perspective.) The Cavs belatedly rallied in the late 80s with Brad Daugherty, Mark Price and Ron Harper ... and then this happened.\nRed Right 88, The Drive, The Fumble, The Shot, The Stepien Rule, and \n all in one decade? The only person who had a worse time in the 1980s than Cleveland fans was Little Bill from \n. If you believe God hates Cleveland, then youd have to believe that that antipathy was firmly in place for the 1980s. So, when? When did it start? Somewhere between the Miracle of Richfield and The Drive, right?\nHeres my convoluted theory:\nThe tipping point happened on December 14, 1980. Things were already quietly crumbling for Cleveland sports fans. Stepien had just traded unprotected first-round picks in 1983, 1984 and 1986 for three bench players (Mike Bratz, Jerome Whitehead and Richard Washington) and two months later, hed flip his 1985 first-rounder for somebody named Geoff Huston.\n The sad-sack Indians were kicking off their third straight decade without a playoff appearance. And the 29 Cleveland fans who still loved hockey were being tormented by that rejuvenated Barons-Stars hybrid, which made the 1980 conference final and was a few months away from Minnesotas first Stanley Cup final (in 1981).\nSo what did Cleveland fans have going for them? The never-unsuccessful-for-long Browns, recently reinvented as the \"Kardiac Kids\" after tallying a whopping 10 come-from-behind wins in 1979 and 1980. In the second-to-last game of the 1980 season, the 10-4 Browns led in Minnesota by one point with 14 seconds left. The Vikings were stuck on their own 20 without any timeouts. Their win expectancy rate was basically \"No F- - - ing Chance.\" Which is what makes the ensuing YouTube clip legitimately amazing.\nFirst, the Vikings execute a hook-and-ladder that fetches 39 yards AND stops the clock (0:18 mark of clip). A \n hook-and-ladder? When does that ever happen? On the next play (1:10 mark), QB Tommy Kramer throws a Hail Mary moonball that somehow gets tipped right to Ahmad Rashad (yes, THAT Ahmad Rashad) for the miraculous game-winning score.\nI repeat:\nA 34-YARD HOOK-AND-LADDER IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY A 46-YARD HAIL MARY CAUGHT BY AHMAD RASHAD.\n Find me a crazier two-play sequence in football history that doesnt involve the \n running back shooting potential tacklers.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVrsGHs2MCk.\nWhat happened next? The Vikings won the NFC Central title thanks to those 14 seconds, winning a division tiebreaker with 9-7 Detroit that still somehow ranks as one of the 20 greatest moments in Lions history. Meanwhile, the Kardiac Kids (seemingly) regrouped by winning in Cincinnati with another go-ahead fourth-quarter drive. Don Cockrofts 22-yard field goal clinched the first AFC Central title\n by a non-Steelers team since 1973. The Browns received a Round 1 bye, then hosted Oakland in a Divisional Round ice-fest (2 degrees Fahrenheit, minus-30 wind chill) that doubled as the NFLs coldest game in 13 years (since 1967s historic Ice Bowl). Look, it even cracked the top 10 in the \n. Congratulations, Cleveland!\nHmmmm, who controls horrible weather? Oh yeah, thats right: GOD.\nAnyway, Oaklands Mark Van Eeghen scored a go-ahead touchdown with 9:22 to play, putting the Raiders up by two.\n Cleveland punted, then Oakland punted. With less than five minutes remaining, the Raiders recovered Brian Sipes fumble on Clevelands 24.\n (Poor Sipe finished 13-for-40 with 0 TDs, three picks, a fumble and a QBR about as low as the wind chill.) The Raiders killed the clock with three runs, but couldnt risk a field goal on fourth-and-a-foot from Clevelands 15 in frigid conditions. They handed off to Van Eeghen ... and Clevelands defense stuffed him.\nHERE COME THE KARDIAC KIDS!!!!!\nOK, fast-forward to the 24:38 mark of that video. 2:20 remaining. Raiders 14, Browns 12. Youll hear a giddy Don Criqui telling us to \"fasten all seat belts\" not once but twice. After we finish buckling in, Sipe hits Ozzie Newsome for 29 yards on second down (25:36 mark), gets a crucial pass-interference penalty three plays later (28:26), then hits Greg Pruitt on a pretty 23-yard pass to move inside Oaklands 30 (29:50). A second-down draw play to Pruitt earns 14 more yards (31:40 mark). First down on Oaklands 14. Timeout, Cleveland.\n\"They called timeout. They still got two left, though,\" color analyst John Brodie says. \"Fifty-six seconds left to play. What do you do? You run the ball into the line, you think Cockroft can kick it from 30 yards ... In my opinion, they better try to score it. Sipe will throw it in the cheap seats if everyones covered. But I think its easier to complete a pass than it would be to convert a field goal.\"\nQuick background: The 35-year-old Cockroft converted only 33 of his 55 field goal attempts in 1979 and 1980, then would retire after this game. In a 2006 interview, Cockroft admitted that he was battling two herniated discs and had four epidurals during the 1980 season. Yes, I learned this from \n. And yes, you know something awful happened when a sporting event has its own Wikipedia page. But four epidurals? Is that even legal? Remember the days when the NFL didnt care about player safety, unlike now? (Hold on, Im going to wait until you finish guffawing.) In that Raiders game, Cockroft made two field goals (both from 30 yards), missed two more (from 47 and 30 yards) and shanked an extra point. So he wasnt exactly lights-out. And it was 2 degrees and windy and freezing. And the field was basically a skating rink. And again: FOUR EPIDURALS.\nNope, you cant blame the Browns for wanting to inch a little bit closer. Especially when they didnt know that God hated Cleveland yet.\nOn first down, Pruitt ran the ball into the line for one yard (33:00 mark). Timeout, Cleveland. Forty-nine seconds left. Sipe jogged to the sidelines, savoring the last 90 seconds of a promising career before everything went to hell. Browns coach Sam Rutigliano called \"Red Right 88\" and told Sipe to \"throw it into Lake Erie\" if everyone was covered. The pass play was designed for Browns receiver Dave Logan (crossing short over the middle), with Newsome serving as Sipes backup option in the end zone. For whatever reason, Sipe ignored Logan and threw to Newsome with two Raiders blanketing him (34:00 mark). Interception, Mike Davis. Game over.\nIts one of the most unforgettable \"Why did he throw that?\" NFL passes of the past 35 years, right up there with Favres backbreaking pick against the 2010 Saints and every third Jay Cutler interception. Why not run the ball two more times and take your chances with Cockroft? What about a screen pass or a short out? Why risk throwing it over the middle into double coverage? Why? Why????? WHYYYYYYYY?\nAs if Red Right 88 werent a big enough karate kick to the groin, the 1980 Raiders went on to beat San Diego and Philly (and steal Clevelands Super Bowl). Poor Sipe quickly morphed into the real-life Shane Falco, only without a \n comeback and an iconic quote like, \"Pain heals, chicks dig scars and glory lasts forever.\" Sipe followed his 1980 Pro Bowl season (4,132 yards, 30 TDs, 14 picks, 91.4 rating) with 1981s abomination (17 TDs, 25 picks, 10 fumbles, 68.2 rating) and retired two years later. By then, the city of Cleveland had already broken ground on the Factory of Sadness. You know the rest.\nStill, its too easy to declare \"Red Right 88\" as the official moment when God decided to hate Cleveland. If the play were called \"Red Right 666,\" maybe Id feel differently. The tipping point happened three weeks earlier. Minnesotas miracle comeback was Gods way of telling Cleveland fans, \n Minnesota pulled off footballs two most impossible big plays in less than 15 real-time seconds combined. A hook-and-ladder AND a Hail Mary? Back to back????\nDecember 14, 1980. Thats the answer. And sadly, I dont have the solution.\nBut I can tell you this:\nFrom the summer of 1986 through September 2001, the Boston sports scene suffered a 15-year swoon that rivaled any 15-year Cleveland stretch. We lived through the Buckner/Schiraldi Game, Game 4 of the 87 NBA Finals, Lenny Bias overdosing, Reggie Lewis dying, Larry Birds back, Kevin McHales feet, Cam Neelys knee, Nomars wrist, Pedros shoulder, Clemens ditching us for Canada and immediately winning two Cy Youngs while borrowing Ivan Dragos training regimen, the Patriots almost moving to St. Louis, Paul Pierces nearly fatal stabbing, the M.L. Carr/Rick Pitino eras, the Tim Duncan lottery, the Parcells-Kraft breakup, the Desmond Howard kickoff (why?????), two of our most hated rivals (the Yankees and Lakers) forming new-age dynasties heading into the new millennium, and, of course, a never-ending World Series drought that spawned an alleged Curse and multiple depressing books.\nIn June 2001, we poured into bars around Massachusetts to cheer on Raymond Bourque, one of the greatest Bruins ever, as he finally won the Stanley Cup ... only it happened with Colorado. I remember watching at a Cambridge bar called John Harvards, rooting for the Avalanche like they were the Bruins, then cabbing it home and thinking, \n I felt like I had just cheered on an old girlfriend on her wedding night as she had honeymoon sex with someone else. How pathetic was that???\n Local columnist Gerry Callahan derisively nicknamed Boston \"Losertown,\" with the Prince of Pessimism (still-toxic \n columnist Dan Shaughnessy, who turned Bostons demons into a cottage industry for himself), WEEIs sneering \n morning show and Glenn Ordways condescending drive-time show as our dark overlords. But in September 2001, Mo Lewis knocked Drew Bledsoe out of a Pats-Jets game and the rest was history. Everything flipped. Just like that.\nIt happens that fast. The truth is, God doesnt hate Cleveland. (Yes, I just pulled off one of those sports media straw-man arguments that I usually hate.) Between the NBA, NFL, MLB and NHL (sorry, Im not ready to count MLS yet), we have 122 professional sports teams and only four available yearly championships. Those are terrible odds!!! What the hell are we doing to ourselves???? Some cities just have better luck than others. Ever gambled at a blackjack table for hours and watched two of the six seats win big, three seats do OK and one seat just get \n And its always your buddy who brought the least amount of money and had to drain his ATM three times during the night? Thats just bad luck. Theres no rhyme or reason to it.\nOf course, theres one underlying dynamic that has to be mentioned -- it became a recurring theme in my baseball columns from 1997 through 2004, as well as one of the main reasons why I strung those columns together for \n. You can pass the point of no return as a fan base. You can be drained of all your collective faith, you can reach the point where you expect the worst at all times, and whenever it happens, it DOES feel like something of a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nThis is a real thing. I once wrote about attending a crucial Red Sox-Indians game with Pedro Martinez (at his peak) and Bartolo Colon (220 pounds lighter) locked in a thrilling pitchers duel. Late in the game, Nomar crushed a line drive that sailed toward the Green Monster and, incredibly, struck the very very very very very top of the wall without actually clearing it. He ended up with the most depressing double I have ever witnessed in my life. You could feel the energy just \n from Fenway. We had a guy on second base, down by a run, but we knew we were going to blow it. And we knew this because we couldnt buy a freaking break as a city, and thats just how it was. Every time I think about how brutal that 1986-2001 stretch was for Boston fans, I always come back to that moment. And I will always believe that players feed off that energy, for better and worse. Nomar didnt score that inning partly because we were sitting there thinking, \n We suffocated the players with our cynicism.\nIts awful when you reach that point as a fan base, or even worse, as an entire city. It really is. Sports shouldnt mean this much, but they do, and thats just how it goes. But again, these things CAN flip. If you want to feel better about being a Cleveland sports fan (or a Bills fans, or a Washington fan, or whatever), read the column I wrote after \n, or after the Red Sox improbably rallied back in \n. When it finally flips, its magical. Ask any Saints fan. Ask any San Francisco Giants fan. Ask any L.A. Kings fan. Ask any Mavericks fan. Ask anyone who thought their team was perpetually screwed, and then suddenly, they realized it was all bullshit and sports is way more random than they thought.\nSo no, I dont think God actually hates Cleveland. But starting with that goofy Vikings game in December 1980, lets at least agree that we have been witnesses to the most obscenely unfair 34-year run in professional sports history. Its going to flip. At some point. (I think.)"}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-sports-guys-week-16-picks/", "blog_text": "If you missed my Friday column trying to figure out the exact moment when God started hating Cleveland (and whether He actually does hate Cleveland), \n.\nAnd now, the Week 16 picks ...\n with the now 3-12 Jags?

It was fun \n into someone who mattered, and as someone who watched you for eight-plus years -- for better and worse -- I am amazed that people dont see your impending Dallas rejuvenation coming. (Think Rasheed on the 2004 Pistons.) And so long, 2008. \n, \n, great times. And with that, I am now ready to Choke More for \n.\nThey canat make this line high enough. And why?\nBS: Noooooooooooo! Noooooooooooooooo! Nooooooooooooooooooo! MY GOD, RYAN LINDLEY IS CLEANING HOUSE! HE CANaT STOP THROWING THE BALL TO SEATTLE! Wait, so what would Ryan Lindleyas entrance music be? Wouldnat it have to be aBetter Mana by Pearl Jam? Literally, they canat find a better man.\n\n\nBS: Well, at least heas not going against the scariest pass defense in the entire league.\n\n\nBS: I recommend throwing the Pats and Seahawks in a three-team, 10-point teaser with (pick any third team that you like). If you lose, you do so to either Geno Smith or Ryan Lindley. Acceptable odds.\n\n\nBS: In 2006, \n for QBs.\n (Shrugging)\n\n\n I mean, hes not a train wreck or anything.\n\n\n You could do worse.\n\n\n You could definitely do worse.\n\n\n You know, hes really not that bad.\n\n\n Ill tell ya, hes NOT that bad.\n\n\n Say what you want about the guy, but he makes plays.\n\n\n Hes not pretty, but hes pretty effective.\n\n\n You could make the playoffs with this guy.\n\n\n Look, if the Ravens could win a Super Bowl with Trent Dilfer ...\nI donat know where Ryan Lindley rates here. Is he just a flat-out 0.0? Are we allowed to go negative? Is he a minus-4? How does this work? As much as I love the thought of Arizonaas unbeaten crowd carrying the \"Nobody Believes In Us\" Cards to an improbable upset win ... I mean ... if Seattle goes up by seven points, the game is over, right? Thereas nothing worse as a football gambler than having a bad QB against a great defense. Repeat: nothing. Arizonaas offense has as much of a chance against Seattleas defense as Texas BBQ had against Joe House.\nPrime Time Peyton Manning against Prime Time Andy Dalton? Thank you, Santa!\nLast note: My Week 17 picks column will be coming next Wednesday, on Christmas Eve. And if you missed our latest \n, itas rerunning on ESPN2 Sunday at 7 p.m. ET and Monday at 11:15 p.m. ET. Enjoy the weekend!\n*"}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/week-17-nfl-picks-2014-superbowl-gambling-prediction/", "blog_text": "I want to find you the perfect Super Bowl bet. Its my holiday gift to you. Were looking for an undervalued long shot with a better chance to get lucky for four weeks than everyone realizes. A good example: Cousin Sal and I dropped some Benjamins on the 2014 Royals right before the AL wild-card game -- 18-to-1 odds! -- and came within a Madison Bumgarner out-of-body experience of cashing in. Could we have cashed in anyway just by hedging that 18-to-1 wager with a Giants bet in Game 7? Of course! Were enormous idiots. Dont ever forget this.\nBut thats the kind of future wager you want to make. Longer odds on an undervalued fringe contender, basically. Our Super Bowl odds heading into Week 17 ...\nNew England: +250\n\nSeattle: +260\n\nGreen Bay: 6-to-1\n\nDenver: 7-to-1\n\nDallas: 10-to-1\n\nPittsburgh: 18-to-1\n\nDetroit: 30-to-1\n\nIndianapolis: 30-to-1\n\nCincinnati: 45-to-1\n\nSan Diego: 55-to-1\n\nArizona: 60-to-1\n\nBaltimore: 70-to-1\n\nAtlanta: 80-to-1\n\nCarolina: 100-to-1\n\nHouston: 400-to-1\n\nKansas City: 1200-to-1\n San Diego (too banged up), Baltimore (atrocious pass defense), Atlanta (atrocious everything defense), Carolina (come on), Houston (stop it) and Kansas City (please).\nAnd lets cross off New England, Seattle, Green Bay, Denver and Dallas because the return on top-five contenders just isnt lucrative enough; youre better off betting on them game-by-game.\nThat suddenly leaves us with three teams:\nPittsburgh: 18-to-1\nCincinnati: 45-to-1\nArizona: 60-to-1\nDid I stare at those Cardinals odds for 20 minutes? You know me too well. Theyre almost definitely headed for a 5-seed and a Round 1 game in Atlanta or Carolina ... and if Drew Stanton comes back in time, thats an exceedingly winnable game. Then, they might have to go to Seattle for Round 2 and... oh, who am I kidding? Cross them off.\nSo that leaves Pittsburgh at 18-to-1 and Cincy at 45-to-1. Whats the right pick? Youll have to wait until the end of this column. Lets hit Week 17 picks and cover everything thats at stake (and I mean \n).\n\n\n The Colts are already locked into the no. 4 seed (barring a Bengals-Steelers tie), as well as probable \"home dog\" status in Round 1 ... with one more loss, Tennessee clinches the no. 2 overall pick (Shame Us For Jameis!) and maybe even the first overall pick if Tampa beats New Orleans (Suck For The Duck!), as well as its worst season in almost 30 years ... Ken Whisenhunt could lose his 25\n game out of his last 28 (not a misprint) ...  Trent Richardson needs 34 more yards to break 1,000 yards (for 2013 and 2014 combined, and only as a Colt, but still).\nBS: Poor Baltimore is reeling -- the Ravens thought theyd lock up the 2014 Bad Good Team trophy by beating Cleveland in Week 17, then finishing 10-6 even though they (a) never beat another 10-win team after Pittsburgh in Week 2, and (b) lost to the Colts in Week 5 in what should have been the Bad Good Team championship game. But Indy losing to the Steelers, Pats and Cowboys since Week 8 by a combined 135-61 margin is just tough to overcome. Dont worry, you still won 2014s Karma Police award, Baltimore. Sing it, creepy Polish band that might give me nightmares tonight!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVocTGX7ouQ\nBS: Bonus points because Hasselbeck threw us off the scent by announcing a Week 10 Fox game (during Indys bye week). Lots of dumb award honors for Indy this year -- they also won the \"How The Hell Could Anyones Running Backs Be This Bad?\" award, the \"Second-Worst Trade Of The Decade\" award (Trent 3.0 for a first-rounder), the \"Most Embarrassing NFL Owner Of 2014\" award (a true achievement during the same year of Ray Rice/Steve Bisciotti) and the \"AFC Playoff Team Everyone Is Excited To Wager Against The Most To The Point That Theyd Be A Stealth Nobody Believes In Us Candidate If They Werent So Fundamentally Limited\" award.\nBS: So the Jags have a rookie QB who looks like a 50-year-old Pete Sampras, an owner who looks like Ron Jeremy and a year of unfounded Jags-moving-to-London rumors ... and those three things make them less anonymous and more relevant than the 2014 Titans? (Thinking.) Yeah, youre right. Mike inspired me to visit \n to see which Titans jerseys were for sale. The first four jerseys they were hawking: no. 31, no. 82, no. 10 and no. 13.\n(Hold on, Ill give you a second to guess the names ... )\n(Just a few more seconds ... )\n(And ... time!)\nIn reverse order ...\nNo. 13? Kendall Wright\n\nNo. 10? Jake Locker\n\nNo. 82? Delanie Walker\n\nNo. 31? Bernard Pollard\nThats right, the no. 1 Titans jersey right now is Patriots dynasty assassin Bernard Karmell Pollard. YOU BURN IN HELL, TENNESSEE! BURN IN HELL!\n\n\n By losing, Tampa Bay wins the no. 1 overall pick (and the Marcus Mariota Sweepstakes) ... theres also a 1.05 percent chance that its Drew Breess last Saints game and a 17.8 percent chance that its Sean Paytons last Saints game ... oh, and dont rule out Jimmy Graham catching 12 passes for 230 yards and three TDs as one last F.U. to every fantasy owner that he tormented this season.\nBS: Finally, a worthy candidate to replace Roger Goodell -- its Commissioner Dan Bingler! I loved all three of these ideas, although you should expand it to cover fumbles. Just call them Schaubs (for Game-Killing Turnovers) and Delhommes (for Season-Killing Turnovers). Id also want to see a stat called a MoMur (Momentum Murderer), which covers any momentum-swinging second-half turnover along the lines of Breess Week 1 interception in Atlantas end zone (when the Saints were leading by three in the third quarter). On Monday night, Peyton Manning had four interceptions, including one MoMur (Adam Joness pick in Denver territory with 13:11 left to play) and one Schaub (Dre Kirkpatricks pick-six on an atrocious pass).\nIn general, it drives me crazy that we dont measure big-picture parts of games in more entertaining ways. I always thought the NBA needed a \"Best Ball\" award for every game -- for the best player on the court in that specific game -- just because Id love to know at the end of every season who had the most Best Balls, which random players had the most Best Balls, and which great players over the course of history had the most all-time Best Balls and one-season Best Balls. Id assume MJ from 1988 through 1993 had the greatest run of Best Balls ever. But who knows? I wish we knew.\nPS: This would work in football, too.\nPPS: Im so proud of myself for laying off the \n Kemp/Antonio Cromartie joke here.\nBS: I love it. Congrats in advance to Tampa for winning the \"JaMarcus for Marcus\" sweepstakes! Im trying my best not to JaMarcus this column, by the way.\n\n\n The epilogue to Marc Trestmans next book, \"When Perseverance Met Jay Cutler.\"\nBS: And you wondered why I grabbed the points.\n\n\nBS: Wait, youre asking for my permission to get hammered when youre a married guy hanging out with your sober in-laws in December in freezing-cold Ottawa? By the way, party at Neils in-laws house! PASS THE COURVOISIER!!!!!\n\n\n Our last chance to enjoy Rex Ryan on the Jets sideline before he either replaces Mike Ditka on \n, steals Phil Simmss no. 1 job at CBS, bumps Bart Scott from CBSs pregame show, signs with Grantland, becomes Bill Belichicks new defensive coordinator or becomes the new head coach of the (pick one: Bears, Falcons, Raiders, Saints, Skins, Niners) ... more important, this is NOT our last chance to wager against Joe Philbin.\nBS: I hope the Jets are dumb enough to fire Rex -- the guy who won them four road playoff games in two years even though Mark Freaking Sanchez was playing QB for him. We always hear that youre only as good as your QB. Well, Rexs starting QBs ranked 24\n, 17\n, 26\n, 32\n, 28\n and 30\n in QBR from 2009 through 2014. During that time, the Jets never had a 1,000-yard receiver and only had three 1,000-yard running backs (Thomas Jones in 2009 and Shonn Greene in 2011 and 2012). In the past 12 years, the Jets have drafted one above-average skill position player ... and it was a kick returner (Leon Washington in 2006). And this is Rexs fault?\nFiring Rex and replacing him with Jim Schwartz or Greg Schiano would be the Jetsiest Jets moment since they tackled Delanie Walker to keep themselves from getting a top-two pick.\nBS: Without question, its \n They released it on Christmas Day in 1990, to tepid reviews that everyone refused to believe. I saw it that day with my stepfather, the worlds biggest \n fan; by the midway point, I had checked out while he kept imploring me to \"Come on, give it a chance\" and saying \"Its gonna get better, Coppola has this all planned out.\" He was in total denial. It was like watching someone stand over a dead body after the sheet has already been pulled over it and saying, \"Its OK, its OK, hell be fine, hes OK.\" An hour later, we were stumbling out of the theater in holiday shock, only there wasnt an Internet yet that allowed us to go on a message board to trash the script or Sofia Coppolas performance. Bah humbug.\n\n\n Nothing. By the way, thanks for the no. 1 seed, Peyton Manning! What a great gift! You shouldnt have!\n\n\nBS: I like this point. All six guys you mentioned bring something historically unique to the table. Popovichs Spurs team created the \"Pace and Space\" mind-set thats transforming the NBA right now, and he invented a smarter way for contenders to use their extended benches so the regular-season grind doesnt wear them out. Belichicks year-after-year success during the Salary Cap era is impossible. Bochy won three titles in five years in a sport thats a postseason crapshoot. Calipari mastered the One-And-Done Factory game plan. Saban conquered the SEC and created a dynasty in a sport that seemed dynasty-proof. My biggest gripe: including Mourinho (never won a 2014 title) over two-time Stanley Cup champ Darryl Sutter! How dare you!\nBS: Happy holidays to you, too, Sam!\n\n\n Denvers no. 2 seed (if Cincy loses, Denver gets the no. 2 seed anyway) ... three more hours of people wondering, \"Does Peyton look right?\" ... the punchers chance of an Oakland upset win saving the Tony Sparano era.\nBS: I mean ... SOMETHING is going on.\nFirst 8 Weeks, 2013: 2,919 yards, 29-6 TD/INT, 8.8 YPA, 119.4 rating\n\nLast 8 Weeks, 2013: 2,558 yards, 26-4 TD/INT, 7.9 YPA, 110.7 rating\n\nFirst 7 Weeks, 2014: 2,134 yards, 22-3 TD/INT, 8.5 YPA, 119.0 rating\n\nLast 8 Weeks, 2014: 2,320 yards, 17-12 TD/INT, 7.5 YPA, 89.7 rating\nTwo incredible follow-up points that I cant believe I am even typing ...\n Were indefinitely suspending the \"Never bet against Peyton Manning in a night game\" rule. Cant retire it yet ... but I can definitely suspend it.\n Playoffs, cold weather, my beloved Pats hosting in Foxborough ... and Id rather see Denver come to town than Pittsburgh. I dont know what to tell you. In the words of Selena Gomez, the heart wants what it wants. (And yes, you know I have a 9 1/2 -year-old daughter because I just quoted a Selena Gomez song.)\n\n\n Eli Manning locking down his best statistical season (highest passer rating, most TDs, best TD-INT ratio, second-highest passing yards, most PSA commercials where he stares blankly into a camera) ... Mark Sanchezs chances to ever start another NFL game ... Philly joining the \"9-3 to 9-7\" Club ... Philly Sports Radio moving from Defcon 3 to Defcon 2 with its \"Maybe Chip Kelly ISNT a genius\" narrative ... and Odell Beckham needing one more 150-yard/two-TD/one circus catch game to win the Offensive Rookie of the Year and officially become the no. 1 pick in 2015s New Yorks Most Beloved Professional Athlete draft.\nBS: I dont think that worked. What about the Philly morning show anchor who read an indecent email on live TV without knowing it was obscene, culminating in her cohost trying to save the day by saying, \"Hey, did you guys hear that the Eagles won?\"\n\n\n Seattle could clinch a no. 1 seed as long as there isnt a Packers-Lions tie\n ... Russell Wilson needs 164 passing yards and 58 rushing yards to join Randall Cunningham in the 3400/900-Yard Club ... Jeff Fisher could clinch his third straight seven-win season ... the number of fans who say to themselves, \"Wait, Jeff Fisher only finished over .500 six times in 20 years????\" could double.\nBS: Yup ... these are my readers.\n\n\n\n\nArizona could clinch a no. 2 seed (if Seattle loses) and a no. 1 seed (if Seattle AND Green Bay lose)\n ... Dallas could clinch a no. 2 seed if Seattle AND Arizona lose ... Tony Romo could heat up his faint-but-heartwarming MVP chances ... DeMarco Murray needs 27 more carries to reach 400 and earn his own \"DONT SIGN HIM!!!!\" chapter in the 2015 \n ... one more quality RG3 game could suck D.C. fans back into the RG3 era (you know its true, too) ... Cards fourth-string QB Logan Thomas could suck some people in, or he could just suck ... this might be Jim Harbaughs last Niners game ... oh, and the Cards could become the first playoff team to clinch home-field advantage while getting six points against a 7-8 team that has lost four straight.\nBS: Congrats to Tony for being the 200\n D.C. area football fan to send me this joke.\n\n\nBS: Its insane. From September 2011 through 2013, Harbaugh won 36 of 48 regular-season games, won five of eight playoff games and came within a first down of winning the Super Bowl. And everything fell apart in 2014 -- which wasnt even remotely shocking when you factored in the Aldon Smith/Ray McDonald incidents, the aborted Harbaugh/Cleveland \n, their brutally competitive division and an unusually tough schedule. \n before Week 1:\n\"I love San Diego as 2014s surprise 12-win contender, Tampa Bay as 2014s \"Nobody Believes In Us\" sleeper, Baltimore as 2014s comeback team, Cincy as 2014s Slightly Undervalued Contender, and Minnesota as 2014s super-frisky non-playoff team. Im also waaaaaaaaay down on Carolina and Kansas City; I think the Falcons, Cardinals and Jets are worse than people think; Im petrified of the QB situations in Buffalo, Houston and Washington; and Im worried that San Francisco might have a Year From Hell Season.\"\nNot bad! Oh, wait, I picked the 2-13 Bucs as a sleeper and declared 2014 the \"Year of the Dog\" even though favorites have covered at a higher success rate. Forget it. But a disappointing 2014 Niners season was always in play. And if Harbaugh is one of those withering, high-intensity, burns-you-out-after-three-years head coaches, then maybe college IS the best place for him. Its just hard for me to believe that, just five months ago, \n in the history of any Trade Value column ... and now that coach is going to be more satisfied fleeing the NFL entirely so he could beat up on Northwestern and Purdue. Nick Saban wasnt a very good pro football coach. Jim Harbaugh ia a SUPERB pro football coach. Hes overqualified for college.\nMy take: I think hes using that Michigan offer as leverage so that his next NFL team (Chicago, Atlanta, New Orleans, whomever) doesnt have to pay a big ransom for him. And by the way, how much fun would a Sean Payton/Jim Harbaugh trade be? Cant we just call that in now?\nBS: This reminds me of an old Malcolm Gladwell riff -- Ryan Lindley is something like the 62\n best professional quarterback in the world. In how many other jobs could you feel like a complete failure for being the 62\n best in the world at anything?\nBS: Too. Soon.\n\n\nSan Diego gets the no. 6 seed by winning ... If Kansas City wins, they get the no. 6 seed if Baltimore AND Houston lose (good luck with that) ... the 0-TD record for KCs receivers ... Phil Rivers needs one more come-from-behind win while battling eight different injuries and a herniated disc to grab Ben Roethlisbergers \"Toughest QB Alive\" belt ... K.C. fans are one more must-win defeat from feeling terrible about themselves again ... speaking of K.C. fans feeling terrible, its the final installment of Americas favorite sports stadium game show, \n ... and San Diego can break the \"Most Centers Ever Used During One Season\" record.\nBS: Also at stake -- Andy Reid has a chance to lose one more big game. By the way, theres a one-in-five chance that a Sloan Conference panel in two months will break down all the head-scratching decisions from this Chiefs-Chargers game. \nBS: Random prediction: THIS IS THE WEEK! Were gonna see a touchdown by a Chiefs receiver! I love the Chiefs this week. A SoCal team in cold weather, a truly banged-up Chargers squad, a half-empty Chiefs bandwagon, Mike McCoy doing Mike McCoy things, the free half-point from Vegas, the inevitable week when San Diegos luck finally runs out,\n and best of all, the door opening just a crack for James Wattman to film \n in the actual playoffs.\n\n\n\n\n Baltimores win earns the no. 6 seed if San Diego loses ... Houstons win earns the no. 6 seed if Baltimore AND San Diego lose ... Cleveland could land two top-15 picks if it loses and Buffalo loses ... Baltimore could become \nsince 1991 to miss the playoffs ... J.J. Watt could swing the MVP ballot with another monster game that ends with Watt doing everything short of pulling Blake Bortless arms off and clubbing him over the head with them ... Jacksonville gets nothing and likes it.\nBS: Thats the most interesting thing I learned about Cleveland after \n. The second most interesting thing: In the \n clip that I posted, the pistol-packing running back plays for the L.A. Stallions and shoots defenders from the Cleveland Cats. Oh, and the actor playing that running back is Billy Blanks. So thats a clip of the Tae Bo guy shooting Cleveland football players. Ladies and gentlemen, one more time, lets hear it for Cleveland sports!\n\n\nBS: I am not concussed. Passed the tests and everything. I dont believe that any of the QBs grabbed the award -- not even Rodgers, who put up 36 combined points against three of the top four defenses (Seattle, Detroit and Buffalo) and went 3-3 against his only six above-.500 opponents. Rodgers got to play the NFC South and four games against the Bears and Vikings. I think hes the best QB in football. But hes had better years -- he didnt WIN the award. Neither did Brady, Romo, Wilson or any other elite QB.\nHeres a good rule of thumb from my NBA MVP reasoning: \"\n Isnt that J.J. Watt? Arent we going to be remembering this as the J.J. Watt season? According to \n ...\nPlayer A: 17.5 sacks, 43 hits, 49 hurries, 10 tipped passes, 56 stops\nPlayer B: 18 sacks, 11 hits, 53 hurries, 5 tipped passes, 46 stops\nPlayer A is J.J. Watt. Player B is the pooled-together stats for Justin Houston, Ndamukong Suh, Ryan Kerrigan, and Connor Barwin if you cherry-picked their highest possible totals.\n So J.J. Watts season is slightly better than the combined highest numbers of the next six guys. Oh, and he has 25 tackles for a loss, three forced fumbles, five fumble recoveries, an 80-yard interception TD (the longest by a defensive lineman in the past 10 years), a 45-yard fumble return TD and three TD catches.\n And hes getting double-teamed pretty much all the time now. If you take him off Houston, its immediately a 3-13 team.\nOn a personal note, hes the best defensive player I have watched, game in and game out, since Lawrence Taylor (our last defensive player to win MVP). J.J. Watt wrecks offenses. He has also inspired me to \n, play out Thunderdome battles \n, and seriously answer questions like \"\n\" What else could he do? The 2014 Texans might miss the playoffs because they plowed through five mediocre-to-worse QBs (Im counting both Ryan Fitzpatrick stints). Theres no other reason.\nAnyway, I think it comes down to this weekend: If Watt destroys Jacksonville, he steals my MVP vote unless Rodgers destroys Detroit at home. As for the no. 6 seed, I think K.C. wins, Houston wins, Baltimore barely holds on against Cleveland thanks to the Browns getting whistled for a record 37 penalties ... and on Monday, Roger Goodell and Steve Bisciotti will play 18.\n\n\n The NFC North title (and a no. 2 seed) ... a possible no. 1 seed for Green Bay (if Seattle loses) or Detroit (if Seattle AND Arizona lose) ... Detroits losing streak in Wisconsin (23 games!) ... Aaron Rodgerss MVP trophy ... the collective psyche of Lions fans ... my $200 parlay of the Packers -7.5 with \"over 75.5 times\" that someone on one of the ESPN/Fox/CBS shows calls suspended foot-stomping Lions center Dominic Raiola either \"selfish\" or \"stupid\" while also saying, \"Theres no place in the game for that.\"\n\n\nBS: I think you nailed it, JL. Although I would have thrown in the obligatory \"Do you know the Lions are 1-10 in the playoffs since 1958?\" nugget. My fears for taking the Lions +7.5, in no particular order: Rodgers in Lambeau; Jim Caldwell; Stafford outdoors; Jim Caldwell a second time; no Raiola; all the Lions-Lambeau baggage; the 2014 Packers at home; the revenge factor from Week 2 (Lions 19, Packers 7); Jim Caldwell a third time; Stafford outdoors a second time.\nBS: And theres that, too. By the way, here were your other \"Most Inept QB-Coach of the Century\" suggestions that trumped Cutler and Trestman ...\n Pat Shurmur and Brandon Weeden; Dave Shula and David Klingler; Rod Marinelli and Jon Kitna/Dan Orlovsky; George Seifert and Chris Weinke; Chris Palmer and Spergon Wynn; Dick Jauron and Cade McNown; Cam Cameron and Cleo Lemon; JaMarcus Russell/Andrew Walter and Lane Kiffin/Tom Cable; Dave Campo and Quincy Carter; Curtis Painter and Jim Caldwell; Mike Singletary and Troy Smith; Brad Childress and Tarvaris Jackson; Marty Mornhinweg and Joey Harrington; Anyone and Romeo Crennel; Anyone and Dave Campo; Dom Capers and David Carr; Mike Mularkey and Blaine Gabbert.\n Danny in Santa Barbara writes, \"I humbly submit to you the 2000 San Diego Chargers (1-15). Head coach -- Mike Riley (career NFL record of 14-34); Ryan Leaf (nine starts), an aging Jim Harbaugh (!!!) (five starts), and something called a Moses Moreno (two starts). During a 17-7 loss to the Miami Dolphins in Week 11, all three managed to throw at least one interception.\"\n EZ Seibert in Nashville writes, \"I am downright shocked that you didnt even consider the combo of Greg Schiano and Josh Freeman. It only lasted three weeks in 2013, but in that time they had the MRSA outbreaks, rigged captain elections, leaked personal information, an inconceivable .457 completion percentage, and of course 0 wins. HAS to be in the discussion.\"\n Logan in Chesapeake, Virginia, asks, \"What about the 2006 Raiders? The legendary Art Shell coached a combo of totally-washed-up Aaron Brooks and yes-that-was-a-real-NFL-QB Andrew Walter to a 2-14 record with 6 TDs and 21 picks. Thats not a typo, six touchdowns in sixteen games. Walter was the worse of the two: 8 starts, 3 TD, 13 INT, and an unconscionable QBR of 17.4. Cutler this year (55.0) is closer to Peytons QBR record season (87.2) than he is to 2006 Andrew Walter. Meanwhile, Art Shell was Art Shell and spent most of the season in an undiagnosed coma.\"\n(Your winner: Art Shell, Andrew Walter and Aaron Brooks! I even \n that season AND followed it up with a \n. See, it could be worse, Bears fans. I have one word for you: Perseverance.)\nBS: Jim Caldwell speaks! Are we sure there arent two Jim Caldwells?\nBS: More from fellow Grantlander Steve Hyden, who happens to be a die-hard Packers fan ...\n\"If we compare Rodgers to Tom Brady, Rodgers has a significantly worse coach and no weapon as good as Rob Gronkowski. (Lets not forget that Rodgers beat Brady head-to-head.) If we compare Rodgers to DeMarco Murray or Tony Romo, Rodgers wins because he doesnt have a viable MVP candidate as a teammate. (Murray and Romo cancel each other out.) If we compare Rodgers to Russell Wilson, Rodgers has a significantly worse coach, a worse running back and a much worse defense. If we compare Rodgers to J.J. Watt, sorry, there is no comparison, because Rodgers makes an impact on every offensive play on a team with a much better record. Is there really a solid argument for any other player being more valuable to his team than Rodgers? Hes not just the MVP for 2014, hes the MVP every year. While were at it, lets also give him an Oscar, Emmy, Pulitzer, and Nobel [Prize].\"\nFine, fine, fine. Its a defensible MVP pick. But Rodgers still needs to torch Detroit this weekend to make it official ... right?\n\n\n The NFLs dignity ... the NFC South title (and the no. 4 seed) ... the Mike Smith era ... Cam Newtons chances to get a nine-minute lump-in-the-throat produced segment about his car accident before a Round 1 playoff game that will definitely sample Peter Gabriels \"\n\" ... a possible Atlanta Pro Sports Resurgence with the Falcons and the red-hot Hawks ... our still-flickering chances for a Caldwell-Smith Clock Management Showdown in Round 2 ... and dont forget, were one Cam Newton hit away from getting a potential Ryan Lindley vs. Derek Anderson outdoors playoff matchup in Round 1.\n\n\n\n\nBS: I like Chucks idea more. By the way, I absolutely love the Falcons in this game -- theyre playing in the Georgia Dome, theyre 5-0 against division opponents, they have the leagues eighth-best offense according to DVOA, and theyve covered six of their last eight games. Theyre like the 2007 Pats of the NFC South. This line isnt high enough.\n\n\nBS: Youre right, this line is probably high enough.\n\n\n Winner gets the AFC North title (and a no. 3 seed at least); loser gets the no. 5 seed (and the Colts) ... Cincy could also win a no. 2 seed if Denver loses ... Andy Dalton could officially shed the \"Not Ready For Prime Time\" tag ... Pittsburgh could head into the playoffs 8-2 in its last 10\n ... Roethlisberger could reach 5,000 passing yards (hes 365 yards away) and Antonio Brown could clinch the \n ... if A.J. Green lasts four more quarters, somebody could give him an \"I made it through a 17-week season without one of Andys throws seriously injuring me even though he almost broke my arm in the Denver game\" T-shirt as a belated Christmas gift.\nSpeaking of gifts, its time for me to unwrap your holiday present. (Waiting for you to open the box.) Thats right, its the Steelers at 18-to-1!\nHeres the logic: I see them beating the Bengals and hosting Baltimore in Round 1. Perfect matchup -- Roethlisberger can shred Baltimores secondary again like when he dropped six touchdowns on them in Week 9. After that, you have a Final Eight team with an experienced big-game QB that can drop 30-plus points on anyone. Could they win in Denver and New England? Why not? Denver looks vulnerable and Pittsburghs biggest weakness (giving up deep balls) happens to be the biggest weakness of New Englands offense.\n Heading into Week 17, Tom Brady has thrown deep 58 times, completed just 17 of those passes (34.5 percent -- 19th\nin the NFL) for only five touchdowns (tied for 14th), and caused my dad to text me 27 times this season, either \"GOD FORBID WE EVER COMPLETED ONE OF THESE\" or \"WHY DIDNT WE SIGN STEVE SMITH???\"\nI know, I know ... that Denver/New England road gauntlet seems daunting. But you know what else is daunting? Old quarterbacks in bad weather. And you know what else is daunting? Road playoff teams with big-play receivers (the Steelers have three, including Antonio Brown, the leagues best receiver), a big-play running back (LeVeon Bell is the scariest back in football right now) and a gunslinger QB. As a die-hard Patriots fan who genuinely likes my teams chances this season, still, I am abjectly terrified of Pittsburgh. Do I believe the Steelers will beat Denver, New England AND Seattle back-to-back? Not necessarily ... but I believe they COULD. And thats why you should grab them at 18-to-1 -- because those are really good odds for \"they COULD.\" Merry Christmas.\n(Oh, and Steelers fans? You dont have to send me \"I know what youre doing -- this is one of those patented Simmons reverse jinxes!\" emails. That goes without saying!!!! Merry Christmas to myself for reverse-jinxing the Steelers! WOO-HOO! ENJOY THE SIMMONS STINK, PITTSBURGH!!!!! And happy holidays, everybody.)"}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8813380/nfl-playoff-prognostications", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8835592/the-always-reliable-mailbag", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8856794/the-all-teo-mailbag", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8857601/that-championship-mailbag", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8872264/lakers", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8880436/welcome-retro-photo-diary", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8904906/daring-ask-ped-question", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/67333/running-diary-the-new-fast-furious-6-extended-trailer", "blog_text": "February 5 is now a holiday. In less than an hour this morning, we learned \n, \n was released (LEAGUE OF DORKS ALERT!!!!!!!) and the extended \n trailer surfaced on YouTube. Everybody go home. Just go home. But before you do, lets break down the trailer for the sixth installment of the greatest action franchise of all time.\n \"The following preview has been approved for APPROPRIATE AUDIENCES.\" Im woozy.\n Its sweeping-helicopter-shot time. IN!!! If there were a Sweeping Helicopter Shots Olympics for directors, Id have Justin Lin as a -240 favorite over Ben Affleck in the finals.\n Nobody pulls off the \"being mounted by a hot blonde immediately followed by strutting outside and looking out to a panoramic ocean view while holding a beer\" trailer montage combo better than Vin Diesel. I cant tell you how much I missed Dom Toretto.\n Send this exchange right to the Oscar committee.\n Sweeping helicopter shot! SUCK IT, AFFLECK!\n Our plot: So a team of highly coordinated drivers wiped out a military convoy, leaving the FBI with two choices: send either a team of Seal Team 6 dudes after them, or a top-10 most-wanted felon (Diesel) and a disgraced FBI agent whos on the lam (Paul Walker) to find them. Obviously, you go with Plan B there. \n Dom doesnt want to help out -- after all, hes already rich, hes living in a tropical location and hes getting mounted by blondes. But wait! Rock drops a bombshell: Doms dead girlfriend Letty is alive ... and, yup, she was one of the aforementioned \"highly coordinated\" drivers. She couldnt be alive! In \n, she perished in a car accident that Dom dissected by studying tire-tread marks for about 12 seconds, after which he somehow found the guy responsible just from the tread marks. Shes alive?\n\"Its impossible,\" Dom mumbles. \nI agree. I mean, we saw the tread marks. Doms in.\n Another Vin Diesel staple -- he always looks like hes angrily staring someone down in slow motion even though hes doing it in real speed. Harder than it looks. Im trying this every time someone at Grantland disagrees with me.\n Sweeping helicopter shot!!! Affleck is so effing jealous right now. Hes gotta be going nuts.\n Ill be honest ... this trailer has been a little light on Paul Walker, a.k.a. Keanu 2.0. Are they phasing him out? Im worried. We need Keanu 2.0. Rock is stealing his lines. This is bullshit. Paul Walker is getting Pau Gasoled.\n Dom: \"You got the best crew in the world standing right in front of you. Give em a reason to stay.\" I agree. This really is the best crew in the world. I mean that unironically.\n Our target is Owen Shaw, former spec-op soldier. Got it. Can you show me some cars flipping over and things blowing up, please?\n Thank you!\n For the best crew in the world to help out, Paul Walker wants The Rock to guarantee full pardons all the way around. If he doesnt think thats getting a dramatic pause from The Rock, hes nuts.\n [\n]\n Rock: \"I cant promise you that.\" \n Dom: [\n] \"Thats the deal ... take it or leave it.\" Dom Torettos character must drive Sly Stallone crazy. I guarantee he watches these movies while thinking, \n Fast and Furious \n Cobra\n Dom sets up our first street race by mumbling, \"Ride or die.\" Maybe thats not as profound or inspirational as \"I live my life a quarter mile at a time,\" but then again, what is? Hey, you know whats really sad? Ive seen enough \n trailers to know whats coming next -- were getting a hip-hop song, were getting an action montage, were going to see at least one person jump from one car to another at high speed, and if you dont think a car is flipping over, youre insane.\nNo franchise understands exactly what it is quite like \n.\n Yup.\n Letty gets out of the car and drops this one on Dom: \"Do you believe in ghosts?\" How fast do you think Michelle Rodriguez said yes when they offered her a Letty comeback? 0.19 seconds? 0.75 seconds?\n She just shot at Dom!!! WTF!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? What did he ever do to her? All he did was love her and avenge her death in \n by killing 245 people and causing $10 billion worth of damage! I cant believe this. Im rewinding.\n Hmmmm. Doms wearing a leather jacket and a black shirt when he first sees Letty, but when hes getting shot at, hes wearing an aqua T-shirt. Maybe she didnt shoot at him? More importantly, why the hell was Dom wearing an aqua T-shirt?\n Paul Walker and Keanu Reeves are the Bird and Magic of enjoyably bad acting. The fact that the \"tell me about your father\" scene from \n isnt on YouTube is a collective Internet failure. Weve all failed. I should be able to watch that twice a day. In \n, it looks like their scene figuring out Lettys comeback might be on that level. I dont want to jinx it. Just saying its possible. But heres a taste.\n(Quick tangent: Ive always loved and admired Doms sense of family. The \n franchise, to me, really hinges on three things: an appreciation for driving recklessly while causing as much damage as possible, a genuine appreciation for family, and the suspension of disbelief that American law enforcement would never be able to find a bald fugitive who lives lavishly, owns lots of expensive cars, and fully admits to FBI agents that hes not hiding. Its totally realistic to me that he would forgive Letty.)\n May 24. Got it. Already on my calendar.\n We just went from two cars on fire that were flipping in midair right to a girl-on-girl fistfight. How many days away is May 24? (Checking.) Fewer than 100 days!\n Ludacris [\n]: \"Ah, guys? They got a tank.\" Tremendous.\n I gotta admit, Im pretty intrigued by this tank. Huge monkey wrench. I mean, its a tank. Its just wreaking havoc right now. \n Great montage here. Includes a car flipping over and going through a glass window, someone jumping forward from one speeding car to another (forward????), The Rock leaping through the air and punching someone at a 45-degree angle, Vin holding an assault rifle while looking intense and ... wait, where was Paul Walker? Im telling you, theyre phasing him out. Im concerned. They better not replace him in \n with Chris Pine or something. I wont handle it well.\n Did we just see the worlds greatest crew drive under a plane that was about to take off, shoot something at it, then drag the plane back down so it crashed behind them? Yes. Yes we did.\n Did Dom then somehow drive his car through the front of the plane? Of course he did.\n Im watching it again.\n 17 OUT OF 4 STARS."}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8951206/ewing-theory-revisited", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/51360/the-lakers-lose-buss-the-nba-loses-a-titan", "blog_text": "The Lakers lost their way right around the time Dr. Jerry Buss started dying. This wasnt a coincidence. Within NBA circles, everyone respected Buss so deeply that something relatively impossible happened. Here was the greatest professional basketball owner who ever lived, an influential power broker who controlled one of the leagues wealthiest franchises  only word never \n leaked about Busss grave condition. He spent the past year fighting cancer in a hospital bed, somehow keeping his privacy (and his dignity) in our Twitter-fueled, rumor-soaked media climate. Nobody would write about it. Or mention it. Everyone respected him too much.\nLike every other NBA fan, I believed for years that Buss was a renegade playboy billionaire, someone who almost seemed like a parody of a sports owner. After he dropped $67.5 million for a Los Angeles winter sports monopoly in 1979, the \n carried the subhead, \"Jerry Buss has always had a way with a chick, a cue and a buck. Now hell have his way with the Lakers, Kings and Forum.\" What else did you need to know? Over the next few years, his Showtime Lakers captured the 1980s better than just about anything -- smoking-hot cheerleaders, courtside celebrities, flashy fast breaks, genuine star power, excess, excess and more excess. They were the hottest ticket in town, the best basketball team of that decade, a team that partied almost as extravagantly as their owner did.\nThe Lakers remained relevant for three solid decades (and counting), reinventing themselves three different times and winning Dr. Buss 10 championships along the way. Thanks to Dr. Jerrys vision, the experience of attending Laker home games over that stretch had nothing in common with any other sports fan experience, \n. He also never received enough credit for recognizing the NBAs most important currency: star power. Not just finding those stars and building around them, but empowering them, even making them feel like they were part of the teams decision-making process. Even as the leagues salary cap and luxury tax worked against him, Buss kept stacking the Lakers with superstars, knowing that Los Angeles remained his biggest weapon -- the weather, the beach, the celebrities, the ladies, the ritzier neighborhoods, the privacy, the Hollywood connections. Players wanted to play for the Lakers. They wanted to play for Dr. Jerry Buss.\nWhen it became clear that Dwight Howard was pushing his way out of Orlando, an inordinate number of NBA fans just assumed the Lakers would get him, if only because thats what always happened. Thats what Buss built in Los Angeles. Maybe he had his way with a chick, a cue and a buck, but owning a professional basketball team? Nobody was better.\nI first learned of Busss declining health in London, during the Summer Olympics, when league officials were already using the word \"when\" and not \"if.\" Within NBA circles, there was real fear about a post-Jerry world -- not just for what it meant for the Lakers (one of the leagues crown jewels), but what it meant for the league itself. We forget sometimes that 30 owners run the NBA, for better and worse, with David Stern and Adam Silver carrying out their wishes. Their influence drifts into three different groups (old guard, new guard and totally useless) and three different economic realities (small market, big market and middle class). From what Ive been told by multiple people who have participated in those owners meetings, Buss might have been the single most respected person in the room. Maybe he was a big-market/old-guard guy, but he cared about the league as a whole, and he was willing to discuss any idea as long as it made sense. He had a knack for staying quiet for hours, then somehow making the most salient point of the day.\nOne time within the last couple of years, when the small-market owners were pushing hard for revenue sharing, Buss waited for everyone to make their case before weighing in. He mentioned how one owner had juggled multiple businesses over that time -- making hundreds of millions beyond basketball -- whereas Buss had thrown his life into running the Lakers. Now that owner wanted Buss to share his NBA profits with him? Buss maintained that he wasnt against revenue sharing; if anything, he believed the idea made sense. But could they at least agree that, had the other owner devoted all of his time and resources to his team like Buss did, his franchise would be doing better? What if they struck a deal -- all the full-time NBA owners shared their NBA profits, but only if the part-time NBA owners shared the profits from their other businesses with the full-time NBA owners?\nThe room fell silent. He had totally defanged the other owner -- not to embarrass him, but to prove a point. If the league was gravitating toward revenue sharing, he just wanted to make sure it was for the right reasons, not because a handful of unsuccessful, part-time NBA owners were trying to game the system their way. And yes, Buss eventually agreed to revenue sharing. But he made everyone think about it, too.\nSo over these next few days, when you hear other NBA people talk reverentially about Dr. Buss, it wasnt just about titles for them. It was about those moments behind closed doors, when something happened and everyone realized, \"Oh yeah, thats why hes been so successful.\" Thats what the NBA is losing -- not just a shrewd billionaire who transformed the Lakers into a perennial contender worth billions, but a visionary, a thinker, someone who made the league better and smarter and bigger and richer and, over everything else, a little more interesting. Nobody tapped into the sweeping potential of a professional basketball franchise quite like Dr. Jerry Buss did.\nHis final major decision ended up being his worst: Jerry passed the Lakers off to one of his sons for sentimental reasons, not logical ones, and now that same son is running Jerrys beloved franchise into the ground. For only the third time since 1976, they might miss the playoffs. They might lose a marquee free agent (Howard) for the first time in the \n of the franchise, which would really mean that an All-Star looked at the NBA landscape and said, \"All things considered, Im better off not playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.\" And if it happens, just know that it never would have happened on Dr. Jerry Busss watch. I believe these next few years will cement his legacy. Sometimes you dont know what you have until its gone."}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8970449/the-trade-deadline-exchange-part-1", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9002028/the-best-bargains-nba", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9030601/the-worst-contracts-nba", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/71945/the-walking-dead-gives-em-what-they-want", "blog_text": "My son and I play a game called \"Zombie.\" Basically, I chase him around while pretending to be a zombie and making those hungry/throaty zombie noises, then I finally catch him and pretend to gnaw on his arm or leg. He giggles the whole time. Little kids love zombies. You know who else loves them? Adults! \n is hotter than ever; its drawing higher ratings for AMC than NBCs top three shows combined. With another \n season wrapping next week, its important to remember the five ground rules we established in Season 3.\n\nEvery Sunday night, no matter what, youre gonna get to see zombies die. Would you like to see someone shoot a zombie in the head so their zombie brains splatter everywhere? What about multiple zombies getting decapitated by a samurai sword? Any interest in an arrow zipping through a zombie skull, or maybe even a butchers knife getting rammed through a zombie eyeball? Youre getting these things. In spades. Every week. Count on it. \n\nIf a character isnt working, dont worry -- they arent sticking around for an extra few years like Dr. Melfi, Andrea Zuckerman or even Billy Packer. Theyre getting killed off. And guess what else? Theyll kill off people you like, too. Its quite liberating. Youre always on your toes.\n\nYou know those \"comic relief\" characters that every show has? Dont count on seeing one in \n. Every character looks like theyre passing a kidney stone at all times. Its the zombie apocalypse, after all. No jokes, no laughs, no sarcasm  save that shit for Twitter. Were trying to kill zombies here. \n\nAfter Osama bin Laden was killed, the most hated person on the Internet became Ricks wife on \n. And this was well earned. Terrible mother, terrible wife, floozy, hypocrite, manipulator  and none of these things were intentional. This was like watching the WWE screw up one of their \"good guy\" characters, only in this case, Ricks wife couldnt really go heel because of what it would have done to her son, Carl. When they finally killed her off during childbirth and had her son shoot her before she became a zombie, I actually said the words, \"I dont think they went far enough -- I wanted to see one of those zombies eat her face off.\" I rarely agree with showrunners overreacting to the whims of Internet fans, but in this case, Ricks wife had to go.\n\nI just wanted to make sure you didnt forget Ground Rule No. 1. By serving a never-ending slew of zombie deaths and blowing its budget on extras and special effects -- not famous actors, or even good actors -- AMC has stumbled into \n for television (\n?). I dont care if anyone survives on this show except Daryl (the guy with the bow and arrow), Maggie and Hershel. But if you told me Id go five weeks without seeing a zombie get decapitated? Id flip over my coffee table. The people running \n understand this now. Which is why these two clips are related.\nAnd \nSo those were the new stakes heading into last nights second-to-last episode. Season 3 revolved around a brewing holy war between Woodbury (a gated community led by the increasingly evil \"Governor\") and Ricks crew (The Rickettes, who live in an abandoned prison). Two Sundays ago, the Govs former flame (Andrea, a former Rickette who had about 760 chances to kill the Gov and somehow blew all of them) brokered a sit-down between the Gov and Rick that became gripping for the bad acting more than anything else. Poor Guy Who Plays Rick. He just sucks. You know hes bad because he made The Governor look like Daniel Day-Lewis, and I think they hired him straight from a British porn set. Again, you dont watch this show for the acting. \nThe Governor presented Rick with a moral dilemma: If he delivered Michonne (a mute, dreadlocked, samurai sword-wielding African American badass) to Woodbury, theyd have peace. The Governor wanted Michonne to pay for murdering his zombie daughter (hed been keeping her alive in case someone came up with a zombie cure), impaling his eye (now covered with an eye patch) and just generally looking like Tracy Chapman (he hated \"Fast Car\"). If Michonne wasnt delivered, wed have war.\nJust one problem: As the leader, Rick always made big-picture decisions that protected the group while setting some sort of example for his future serial killer of a son, Carl  who is clearly headed for an adulthood of killing hookers who look like his mom (assuming they make it out of the zombie apocalypse, but whatever, thats still a few years away). Handing over Michonne to get tortured/degraded/murdered by the Governor  wheres the decency in that? \nIn last nights episode, after Rick asks if he should give up Michonne, Daryl sums it up best by saying, \"This aint us,\" and Hershel adds, \"No, it isnt.\" \nNo kidding. Hey, Rick, heres an idea -- throw everyone in a few cars, hightail it out of there and try to find a safer nesting place. This isnt rocket science. Whats so great about a dark prison that stinks of festering zombie guts? Instead, Rick finds Merle -- Daryls one-armed psychopath brother, the resident loose cannon of the Rickettes and someone who once tried to murder Michonne -- for Merles take on the whole situation. This was like Jerry Jones going to Roger Goodell and saying, \"Hey, I was thinking of signing Jonathan Vilma. What would you do?\" \nMerle senses Ricks apprehension and throws a curveball, going on the offensive (\"You cold as ice, Officer Friendly\") before cutting right to the heart of the problem. \n\"I dont know why I do the things I do,\" Merle says. \"Im a damned mystery to me. But I know you, Rick. Yeah, I thought a lot about you. You aint got the spine for it.\" \nIn five sentences, Merle just summed up three years of \n. Rick never had the backbone for this job. He was always the leader by default, because they couldnt find anyone better than him. Theres nothing inspiring about him. Even Carl The Future Hooker Serial Killer knows that his father shouldnt be leading anymore (and said as much a few episodes ago). A little bit later, when Merle confidently predicts to his brother that Rick is gonna buckle, he sounds like Skip Bayless talking about LeBron James during the 2011 Finals. But hes right. Rick WILL buckle at some point. Its the only interesting thing about his character -- were certainly not watching him for his unforgettable charisma.\nSpeaking of bad acting, Michonne would have been the 39th most interesting character on \n. Its amazing how far a samurai sword and a few hundred decapitations can get you. She makes the mistake of killing a few zombies with Merle (our first five deaths of this episode), followed by Merle sucker-punching her, putting a bag over her head and sneaking her out of the prison to solve Ricks problem for him. Next stop: Woodbury! Hes taking matters into his own hands because Rick isnt man enough to do it. \n(Quick tangent: I love Merle -- I have him ranked as Michael Rookers second-best character, just behind Henry from \n and just ahead of the guy from \n who inexplicably blamed Sly Stallone for killing his girlfriend for reasons that remain unclear. I feel bad picking on Poor Guy Who Plays Rick, but think about the acting on \n compared to \n. Rooker wouldve stolen scenes on either show. Poor Guy Who Plays Rick couldve barely cut it as one of The Others. Even if Ricks character was being played by someone as solid as Matthew Fox, its a completely different show.)\nThe Merle/Michonne scenes were surprisingly solid, including two semi-funny lines (\"I wanted my sword back before I got away\" and \"You gotta play the hand youre dealt -- I only got one\") and Merle inadvertently setting off a car alarm while hot-wiring a car, causing zombies to spill out for this weeks contractually obligated someone-is-tied-to-something-as-zombies-approach-them scene (in this case, Michonne). I love when people are tied to stuff as zombies approach them -- its a viewer victory every time. \nAfter wiping out a few more zombies, they resume the drive to Woodbury with Merle telling Michonne about Ricks dilemma. They start talking about the Rickettes. Incredibly, she pulls a Jedi mind trick on him:\nMerle: \"Youre as on-the-outs as I am, girl.\"\nMichonne: \"Maybe -- but at least when the Governors done with me, I wont have to live with myself.\"\nWithin a minute, hes pulling her over and letting her out. Huh???? They have a little moment as she leaves. Then, Merle drives off to take down Woodbury himself. (If they had played \n as Michonne was walking away, I think I would have high-fived my plasma.) Back at the jail, nothing is going on except for Glenn getting testy with Daryl about Merles increased involvement in the Michonne Dilemma, leading to this moment: \nDaryl: \"Maybe you could have a little forgiveness.\"\nGlenn: \"He tied me to a chair, beat me and threw a walker in the room.\"\nYeah, but still! Later, Glenn asks for Hershels blessing because he wants to marry Hershels daughter, Maggie. Why marry anyone during a zombie apocalypse? Because shes \n Hot. In other words, shes pretty as far as actresses go, but in zombieland? She might as well be Katherine Webb in \n standing next to Louie Anderson. Being \n Hot is like being Female Prison Guard Hot or Press Box Hot or Sports Memorabilia Convention Hot  if youre a seven or an eight in any of those male-dominated universes, it feels like a 27. Glenn cant risk losing Maggie to Daryl or something. Hes locking her down.\nNow heres where you say, \"How did Glenn get a wedding ring during a zombie apocalypse?\" \nGreat question. Well, he walked over to the giant fence outside the prison, found a hungry female zombie trying to get to him, then \n How can you not love this show? And by the way, Im 99.7 percent positive Maggie would have been fine with a handshake over a zombie wedding ring. The proposal was just as gooey and awkward as everything else that happens with Maggie and Glenn -- heres hoping their wedding gets cut short when a zombie reverend chews through Glenns tux.\nOne other thing happened back at the prison: Near the end of the episode, The Poor Guy Who Plays Rick gave a speech to the group about how he needed to lean on others more (and stop over-leading). How uninspiring was it? Halfway through, AMC broke out some \n music to spruce it up. Didnt work. Rick finished the crappy speech, then walked off without letting anyone else weigh in. \n What an ass. I wish Carl would accidentally kill him already. \nBack to Merle, if only because well remember this one as The Merle Episode: He infiltrates the outskirts of Woodbury by luring two dozen zombies with him, then rolling a car toward it -- as a distraction -- before hiding nearby and shooting a handful of the Governors guys. (Get it? A handful?) Who ended up foiling Merle and blowing his cover? A stupid zombie! I hate those things! The Gov beats him up, beats him up some more, then finally shoots him dead. So much for the Merle era. If its any consolation, I have him ranked as TVs best Merle ever, narrowly edging Merle from \n.\nOf course, Daryl belatedly followed them out of the prison (he does stuff like that), stumbling on the carnage a few hours later. (Note: Something like 25 people/zombies were killed in that shootout, and maybe 60 over the full hour, putting this episode way up there in John Hollingers Human/Zombie Efficiency Murder Rankings. Thats been the best thing about Season 3 -- the HZEM has been off the charts all year.) Over the past three years, Daryl might be the only \n character with a unanimous approval rating, to the point that Norman Reedus has become the Josh Holloway of this show -- you always watch him thinking, \n In Holloways case, Sawyer was probably the perfect role; he hasnt done much since. Well see about Reedus. \nBut anyone who stuck with this show for three years knew what was coming next. Thats right, Reeduss Emmy moment. Because theres a sixth Ground Rule for \n that I didnt want to spoil too early in this recap. Heres the rule:\n \nThats just the way of \n. So theres Daryl walking through that post-shootout battlefield with blood and guts and dead zombie bodies everywhere, and there are some zombies chewing on a corpse, and theres Daryl walking toward another zombie \n(Its Merle, isnt it.)\nAnd now hes taking a good long look at the zombie \n(Shit, its gonna be Merle.)\nAnd then the zombie looks up from his bloody meal and \n(Dammit.)\nMerle. \nA crying Daryl kept pushing Zombie Merle away before begrudgingly ramming a knife in his chest, then stabbing him in the head 29 times. Its the way of the world in a zombie apocalypse, the bleakest of places, where youre perpetually surviving as youre forgetting how to live. Most convince themselves to protect others, if only because it gives them \n purpose. Rick wants to protect the Rickettes, but really, he just wants to protect his future serial killer son and his newborn probably-not-his-baby that can miraculously fend for itself without help. The Governor wants to protect everyone at Woodbury, as well as the power he garnered there. Andrea cant decide what she wants to protect, so she vacillates back and forth. Glenn wants to protect his \n Hot fiancee and his one-legged father-in-law. Maggie wants to protect Glenn and her dad and her sister who never has any lines. \nLooming over everything: that dreadful moment when a loved one ends up dying, and  then you have to re-murder them. Thats the law of \n. What would you do? Would you put a bullet in your zombie childs head if you knew they werent coming back? Would you kill your zombie dad? Your zombie wife? Your zombie best friend? What would you do? You cant watch this show without thinking about that question. ALL THE TIME.\nThats why Daryl and Michonne have the best gigs on this show.

Last night made it really, really hard. Really hard. Really, really hard. So please, dont consider this an actual column about the 2013 Boston Red Sox. All jinxing strategies remain intact. Instead, enjoy the complete list of classic Fenway moments during the Fan-Filmed YouTube era (2004 to now) that (a) caused utter pandemonium on One Yawkey Way, and (b) will give every Boston fan goose bumps on their goose bumps as they watch these clips over and over again. Youre not gonna believe this, but David Ortiz is involved in a few of them.\n -- The single most important moment in Red Sox history, filmed without sound  its like the Zapruder film of baseball moments. Youre watching what seems to be a normal at-bat and then BOOM! Dave Roberts zips into the screen and changes the franchise forever. I cant decide whether I wish there were sound for this or whether I love that theres no sound for this.\n -- The same cameraman captures Billy Muellers single off Mariano that drove in Roberts, tied the game in the ninth and gave the self-proclaimed Idiots new life. You gotta love YouTube user akjaybo74 -- he only uploaded three YouTube videos in his life, but all three came from the game that altered the destiny of the Boston Red Sox and allowed my father to die some day while saying that he saw the Red Sox win a World Series. Thank you, akjaybo74!\n -- Our dramatic conclusion of the Roberts Game: bottom of the 12th, tie game, runner on first, no sound at all, same cameraman, you can barely see Papi because the technology was so bad back then  and yet its still tremendous. This one staved off a Yankee sweep and happened in the wee hours of Sunday night. Earlier that same day, the Patriots beat Seattle in Foxborough to keep their win streak going. I always thought that would end up being our greatest Pats-Sox combo day. Nope.\n -- Same game, better camerawork, actual sound  only our cameraman didnt start filming until a couple seconds after the big hit. See, we were still figuring out the whole Fan-Filmed YouTube thing in 2004. Baby steps.\n -- Our first great fan-filmed YouTube clip at Fenway includes actual sound (hey, cool -- sound!) and some \n-type camerawork that totally pushes it over the top. You even get treated to some solid incoherent shrieking in the stands and half-decent camerawork after the cameraman recovers from briefly losing his mind. Also, this was probably the \n. Other than that, no big deal.\n -- Papi belts a walk-off two-run homer (trailing by one in the ninth) against Tampa during the stretch run in September, as the Red Sox were trying to win the AL East (they did) and get home field (they did). Bonus points for improved camerawork (with a choppy cell phone, no less) and close-up shots of the celebration. Were heading to a better place with this YouTube thing, you can feel it.\n -- Can I interest you in a special Manny Ramirez cameo titled \"Manny takes it to the Mass Pike?\" Heres Manny finishing off the Angels with a walk-off granny bomb -- although the cameraman didnt catch the part where Manny dropped his bat and \n (which eventually became my permanent Twitter avatar). This clip makes me feel all gooey inside.\n -- Its a special cameo from J.D. Drews $14 Million Grand Slam that swung the Cleveland series!!!!! Our cameraman really carries this one -- from predicting a big hit, to screaming like a maniac, to even turning the camera on himself. Theres a 1 percent chance this was Jimmy Fallon doing one of his old \n sketches about crazy Boston fans. PS: \n.\n -- Coco Crisp completes the \n. This clip sums up that series -- it never gets that goose bumpy and abruptly cuts off before we see anyone celebrating. The Red Sox wouldnt have another fun playoff moment for five solid years. Who knew?\n -- Thanks to advances in technology, suddenly were looking at the \n of fan-filmed YouTube clips. You couldnt pick a better angle (right near the field, right behind home plate facing right field), a better camera (its practically in HD!) and a better job filming (the cameraman absolutely crushes his role here -- theres a chance this was Paul Thomas Anderson). Get your goose bumps ready. I dont know if this will end up being Big Papis last great YouTube moment, but I do know this: Weve come a long way, Fan-Filmed YouTube Clips Of Iconic Fenway Moments!!! I have to go; I want to watch this again."}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9842281/the-grantland-annual-nba-league-pass-rankings", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9877794/call-comeback", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9908161/this-our-papi", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9946744/the-18-limbo", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9980591/return-island-dr-simbeau", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/10018200/all-hail-megatron", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/10045485/all-fixins", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/10089272/the-nba-e-league", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/10129546/gladwell-vs-simmons-v", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/10171708/the-island-dr-simbeau-lives", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/10199559/the-quest-mediocrity", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7432606/all-football-mailbag", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7459090/the-return-all-football-mailbag", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7484119/welcome-back-all-football-mailbag", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7519970/time-change", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7523441/20-questions-part-1", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7525589/20-questions-part-2", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7536111/the-half-bag-super-bag", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7547184/searching-silver-linings-indianapolis", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7562176/the-sports-guy-nba-all-star-team", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7579097/linsanity-bag", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7604660/the-danny-ainge-anniversary-party", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7664492/nba-trade-value-part-1", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7666048/nba-trade-value-part-2", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/20162/28-days-later-the-los-angeles-celtics", "blog_text": "My first \"Celtics at Clippers\" game happened on February 15, 2003, three months after I moved to Los Angeles to write for Jimmy Kimmel. My life was a mess. Jimmys show had just launched a few weeks earlier to tepid reviews; we were working 15-hour days and creating the show on the fly. My then-fiancee had just arrived from Boston without a job or a single friend. Our closest family member was 2,900 miles away. We had stupidly rented an apartment in the wrong area of Hollywood, regretting it almost instantly  but were unable to move for 10 more months. We found ourselves overwhelmed by the size of Los Angeles and beholden to our cars navigation system, to the point that we named our navigation ladys voice \"Carol\" because she had become a bigger part of our lives than anyone else. Only our new puppy, \n, made us feel grounded in any way.\nYou know that annual \n episode when everyone has one family member show up, and the Survivors all start crying as soon as they see them? Thats how I felt seeing the Celtics on that Saturday night. There had to have been 4,000 Boston fans there, everyone wearing green, everyone cheering loudly for every Boston basket, everyone starting \"Lets go Celtics\" chants. I remember we were trailing late, then Pierce and Antoine nailed consecutive 3s and flipped the game our way. The best part happened in the final minute, with every Clippers fan heading for the exits and every Celtics fan sticking around to celebrate. You could only see green. It felt like being in Boston again. You cant have these moments at Celtics-Lakers games because its too difficult for Boston fans to find tickets. But Clippers games? You can have those moments.\nAnd so the annual Celtics-Clippers game became one of my single favorite things about living in Los Angeles. I havent missed a single one. Even if my wife and I love it here now -- we have two kids, two dogs, our own house and a bunch of friends, and we dont need Carol anymore -- that sea of green never gets old. When the NBA was creating its condensed post-lockout schedule in December, I worried about losing that game, even badgering my friends in the leagues office to keep it.\n\"You dont understand,\" I told them. \"This will be my 10th year going to that game. I only care about six days: my anniversary, my kids birthdays, Halloween, Christmas Eve and this game. Thats it. I cant lose that game.\"\nThey ended up keeping it, but not because of me -- they had the Celtics scheduled for a West Coast swing in mid-March and everything fell into place. Thursday afternoons trade deadline gave the game extra meaning for obvious reasons: for all we knew, it was the last time Garnett, Pierce, Rondo and Allen would play together. As the great Bob Ryan remarked a few weeks ago, the Celtics are stuck in Year 5 of a three-year plan. They eked one title out of that nucleus and probably should have won two. Now theyre in no mans land: just good enough to make the playoffs, not quite good enough to seriously contend. They cant get fair value for any of their best players, so it makes more sense to flip expiring contracts and a draft pick for one more impact bench guy  only, they cant find the bench guy, and they dont want to trade the draft pick. To be honest, I dont know what the hell theyre doing. And neither do they.\nWhen youre in flux like that, you end up working backward and asking yourself, \"What do we have?\" In Bostons case, they have three proud veterans, an exceptional point guard, two decent role players and a quality coach. They will fight and they will keep fighting, and thats all we know. Youre not going to break them; youre not going to disrespect them. On Sunday, they traded haymakers with their archrivals the Lakers for 12 rounds. Thirty hours later, the Clippers tried to get chippy with them and the Celtics quickly slid into \"Eff You\" mode. You cant call them dead, simply because it wouldnt be true. For two straight days, I watched them fight.\nI knew we were going to win midway through the third quarter, and not just because Vinny Del Negro was giving the game away by stupidly playing smallball against a team with a depleted front line. Pierce tipped it off: Whenever the team is locked in, and he knows it, he starts carrying himself a little differently. Puffs his chest out, turns to his bench after baskets to feed off their reactions, struts around during stoppages doing his \"nodding and staring down the crowd\" routine. Puts his swagger suit on, basically. His backbreaking 3 with 2:47 remaining didnt surprise me in the least, nor did his reaction afterward -- the slow jog backward, the prolonged stare at his bench, the nodding that always comes with it. For one night, the Celtics were badasses again.\nPeople around the league believe Boston would trade anyone on its roster, including Pierce, if it meant securing some semblance of an identity going forward. Im fine with the identity we have now. People grow old, people change, shit happens. You cant fight it sometimes. I never thought I would live in Los Angeles for a solid decade, but Im still here. I never thought Id be afraid to take my daughter to a Celtics-Clippers game because shes only grown up in Southern California and might instinctively root for the wrong team, but thats life. I never thought one random Celtics road game would mean as much as it does to me, but 10 years later, it does. I never expected to say the words, \"Lets ride this season out even though it makes much more sense to gut the team and start over,\" but Im saying them.\nThe truth is, the Celtics arent getting Dwight Howard or Deron Williams. Blowing things up for a pipe dream makes no sense, especially when the alternative is making this years team better (within reason) and hoping for one last memorable playoff run. The Celtics are what they are: old, proud, stubborn and (mostly) fun to watch simply because they know each other so well. They are going to fall in the first or second round of the playoffs, probably to Chicago in a look-at-how-the-roles-have-flipped bloodbath against the once-precocious Bulls in which they put up the biggest fight you can imagine. And lose. But still.\nOf course, theres a chance that some contending GM caught last nights game, watched what Pierce or Garnett did, and said to himself, \"That guy might push me over the top,\" followed by the Celtics quickly dismantling the Three-Year Plan That Lasted Five Years. And thats fine. Well always have that final minute after the Clippers fans filed out, when it was just the sea of green and a nodding Pierce happily soaking in those \"Lets go Celtics!\" chants again. Leave them alone and the 2012 Boston Celtics will go down swinging. Thats all we know, and frankly, thats good enough for me."}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7739030/a-nervous-exchange-red-sox-e-mails", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7714701/how-annoy-fan-base-60-easy-steps", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7770130/handicapping-nba-mvp-race", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7779341/when-do-draw-line-nfl-violence", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7801091/the-rebirth-celtics", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7809914/absurd-tanking-knicks-surging-miami-madness", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/welcome-back-mailbag-3/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7863321/nba-playoffs-preview", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7883334/the-footnote-title", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7909780/the-new-clipper-nation", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/26601/the-truth-the-whole-truth-and-nothing-but-the-truth", "blog_text": "After Paul Pierce single-handedly won Game 2 of the Atlanta series, a friend of mine e-mailed, \"Has there ever been anyone quite like Pierce?\"\nThe short answer: No.\nThe long answer is a little more fun. Statistically, theres never been a wing player like him. In the regular season, hes already played 37,785 minutes (39th all-time), scored 22,591 points (30th), averaged 22 points a game (30th), grabbed 6,164 rebounds (150th), dished out 3,935 assists (100th), tallied 1,499 steals (40th), earned a 20.7 PER (52nd), submitted a 27.8 percent usage rate (19th), accumulated 131.2 win shares (34th), made 6,101 free throws (17th) and drained 1,679 3-pointers (ninth). The first number (minutes) and the last two (free throws and 3s) explain Pierces career better than anything: Hes one of the finest, most durable inside/outside offensive players ever, and thats before you factor in his career shooting splits (45% FG, 37% 3FG, 81% FT). He also hasnt been a slouch in the postseason: In 116 playoff games (and counting), hes averaged 39.6 minutes (33rd), 21.4 points (34th) and 6.5 rebounds (117th) with 43/35/83 shooting splits, making 190 3s (11th) and 714 free throws (24th) and even winning a Finals MVP (in 2008). Combining the regular season and playoffs, Pierce could approach 45,000 total minutes by the end of Bostons current playoff run. With no sign of slowing down.\nAll right, so lets say Pierce plays four more years (realistic) and finishes with regular-season numbers like 45,000 minutes, 27,500 points, 7,000 rebounds, 4,500 assists, 7,000 made free throws and 2,000 made 3s. Again, those are SAFE estimates. Heres how those numbers would land on the all-time list today: 15th, ninth, 104th, 73rd, seventh and third, giving him a resume that doesnt resemble anybodys -- with one notable exception: Kobe Bean Bryant, whos headed for 50,000 minutes, 35,000 points, 7,000 rebounds, 6,300 assists, 8,500 made free throws, 1,900 made 3s and 45/34/84 shooting splits (if youre making an equally realistic projection for his next few years, removing all future Germany trips).\nEven the biggest Celtics homer wouldnt compare Pierce and Kobe, not when Kobe is already one of the eight best players ever, a superior scorer and a consistently better two-way player. But from a longevity/durability/numbers standpoint? Its not so far-fetched. In 14 years, Pierce played 1,025 of a possible 1,100 games, and that includes the 2006-07 season, when Pierce missed 35 games (about 20-22 more than needed) because Boston was tanking for the Oden/Durant lottery. A few weeks before the 2000-01 season, gangbangers nearly stabbed him to death and he somehow played all 82 games. In 2003, Pierce got crunched by Amare Stoudemire, broke two teeth, spent the next day getting oral surgery and somehow played the next game. Hes just a gritty mfer, one of the toughest Celtics ever  and yeah, I know Im opening myself up to dozens of wheelchair e-mails from the Los Angeles area.\nQuick tangent: When I was growing up, Celtics fans revered John Havlicek for his legendary durability -- by the time Hondo retired in 1978, hed played a then-record 16 seasons, logged a then-record 46,471 minutes and scored a then-incredible 26,395 points. These numbers had no correlation with anything that had happened in NBA history -- which, at that point, was only 32 years old and featured crummy sneakers, bad dieting, coach flights, smoking, poor medical care and everything else that lent itself to short careers. So the thought of another Celtic casually leapfrogging \n would have been staggering in the late-1970s, even if its not as staggering now. By the time Pierces career wraps up, well remember him as the fourth greatest Celtic behind Russell, Bird and Hondo (in that order). Theres just no way around it.\nPierces career stands out for two other reasons. First, his size (6-foot-6, with some bulk) and speed (deceptive) allow him to play either wing spot and defend anyone from prototypical two guards (say, Kobe) to bigger two guards (say, Joe Johnson) to pure small forwards (say, Rudy Gay) to inside/outside forwards (say, Carmelo). You can play small ball and stick Pierce at the four if you want, and if you need to run your offense through him as a point forward, he can pull that off, too. On the \"The Best 50 Players Ever\" list (and hes on it, in the low-40s and climbing), only Havlicek and Scottie Pippen gave their teams the flexibility that Pierce provided Boston these past 14 years. You cant discuss Pierce historically without mentioning that. You can throw any four players next to him -- as long as one could rebound and another could defend point guards -- and fill in the blanks from there regardless of what their skills were. In Game 2 last week, Boston beat the Hawks with Kevin Garnett, Avery Bradley and a bunch of jump shooters and clumsy bangers while running their entire offense through their small forward (Pierce). Ask New York fans -- thats even more difficult than it sounds.\nSecond, Ive been watching Pierce for 14 years now  even if there were times when you may have said, \"Hes probably one of the best 10 players right now\" (specifically: 2002, 2007 and 2009), you never would have called him great or anything. But heres the crucial wrinkle: Hes a very good player who can, occasionally, be great.\nHow many guys have qualified for that specific statement? Lets see  Sam Jones, Walt Frazier, James Worthy, Manu Ginobili, Dennis Johnson, Reggie Miller, Tony Parker, maybe Pau Gasol, maybe Chauncey Billups and two guys I know Im forgetting. Either way, its not a long list, and Pierce has already had a better beginning-to-end career than any retired guy on it. Hes proven that, in any seven-game playoff series, Pierce will become the best player on the floor for two or three of those games. Its not an effort thing; you never watch him saying, \"Wow, Paul is really trying tonight!\" And its not a streakiness thing; he doesnt catch fire the same way that, say, Kobe does. Its something you can see within the first few minutes. You just kind of know.\nAfter Boston beat the Clippers in Los Angeles two months ago, \n: \"Whenever the team is locked in, and he knows it, (Pierce) starts carrying himself a little differently. Puffs his chest out, turns to his bench after baskets to feed off their reactions, struts around during stoppages doing his nodding and staring down the crowd routine. Puts his swagger suit on, basically. His backbreaking 3 with 2:47 remaining didnt surprise me in the least, nor did his reaction afterward -- the slow jog backward, the prolonged stare at his bench, the nodding that always comes with it.\"\nThat exact scenario happened in Game 2, when Pierce knew Boston wasnt winning in Atlanta without Rajon Rondo and Ray Allen unless he had a great game. Not a very good game  a \n game. And then he had one, which was what made it so great. At some point that night, every true Celtics fan knew Pierces dagger 3/slow job/nodding/stare combo was coming -- I would have bet my life on it -- and with about three minutes to go, it finally happened, right on cue. Maybe we need to redefine the word \"great\" a little bit -- when youve been watching someone for long enough that you \n theyre coming through, and then it happens in the exact way you expected, isnt that a form of greatness?\nOf course, its not officially a fun Paul Pierce postseason until hes playing hurt. Pierce tweaked his knee during a Sunday walk-around, then exacerbated it during that nights Game 4 and sprained his MCL. Random coincidence: I sprained my MCL last summer playing hoops, didnt realize it and played a couple more times before realizing something was seriously wrong. (I thought I had just tweaked it.) Whats weird about sprained MCLs is that you can play at about 70 percent speed (as long as you have a brace), but youre always thinking about it, you cant plant hard on it, you cant really move laterally, and youre constantly worried your knee might cave on you. The only way it heals? By resting and \n playing. (Which is what I eventually did. And by the way, Im older and significantly less athletic than Pierce, to say the least.) Of course, Pierce didnt have that luxury, so he played at 70 percent in Game 5 (air balling the potential winning shot) and 70 percent in Game 6, if only because 70 percent of Paul Pierce is better than 300 percent of Marquis Daniels or Sasha Pavlovic.\nWhich is what made the following moment so great \nTrailing by three in the final 90 seconds of Game 6, with a petrifying Game 7 in Atlanta looming, Pierce (trapped in the left corner) rolled the dice for one play, drove hard along the baseline to the basket, up-faked Johnson and somehow willed the ball through the hoop, keeping Boston alive and setting up everything that happened next (Josh Smiths horrific 20-footer, Kevin Garnetts winning basket, Al Horfords missed free throw and a textbook Celtics escape).\nWell remember Game 6 for Kevin Garnetts vintage KG performance, and maybe even for Josh Smith turning into Josh Smith at the worst possible time. Just dont forget that Pierce layup. It was a great play by a very good player, the kind of moment that sets him apart from just about everybody who ever played basketball for a living. I will remember watching you, Paul Pierce."}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7946461/the-nba-award-winning-playoffs", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7960136/the-playoff-eclipse-chronicles", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7988382/the-spurs-zombies-retro-diary", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8016432/gladwell-vs-simmons-iv", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8026268/the-consequences-caring", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8047976/thunder-family-values", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8056767/the-mandatory-nba-finals-power-rankings", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8077467/that-boy-competed", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/lebron-makes-leleap/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8100861/ford-vs-simmons", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8111210/welcome-draft-diary-xvi", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8182261/game-nba-thrones-part-1", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8182319/game-nba-thrones-part-2", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8197963/the-pretend-legend-ladainian-tomlinson", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8204984/10th-checkpoint", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8213663/handball-handball-handball", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8225426/dr-jack-breakdown-swimming-vs-gymnastics", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8238766/great-britain-lives-name", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8249995/olympic-hoopalooza", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8254854/mailbag", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8264283/olympic-mega-bag-part-1", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8266195/olympic-mega-bag-part-2", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8307572/red-sox-nation-hits-reset-button", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8347893/the-new-quarterbacks-league", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8377762/the-mailbag#8211week-2-combo-platter", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8407097/referee-armageddon", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8431439/the-goldengate-mailbag", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8435690/welcome-elaborate-chat", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8465998/the-island-dr-simbeau", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8486795/the-harden-dilemma", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8495054/to-believe-in", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8524001/a-hierarchy-hypocrites", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8538119/jake", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8555451/lebron-quest-immortality", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8573213/the-harden-disaster", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8583255/the-polarizing-michael-vick", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8611122/picking-mike-brown", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8639525/just-go-away-gary", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8660085/the-sports-guy-thanksgiving-football-mailbag", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8694627/the-year-living-cautiously", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8724362/the-kobe-question", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8747330/nfl-qb-power-poll", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/MAYan-apocalypse-holiday-mailbag/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/19979/28-days-later-day-1", "blog_text": "What happens when you combine the NBAs lockout-shortened season with some unforeseen scheduling quirks? You get \n at Staples Center. Heres how I explained it to my wife yesterday morning:\n \"Crazy stretch at the Staples coming up.\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"Starting today, the Clippers, Lakers and Kings have 28 home games in 28 days.\"\n \"Wait, 28 games in  [\n]  youre not planning on going to all of those, right?\"\n \"I was thinking about it. Maybe --\"\n \"If you go to 28 games in 28 days, Im going to start moving your stuff out of the house one game at a time.\"\nSo much for that idea. Hence, a slight tweak: Were covering these 28 games on Grantland as a group effort. I handled yesterdays opening doubleheader, which featured a nationally televised Lakers-Celtics game followed by a Clippers-Warriors showdown three hours later. Now heres a case where Los Angeles might be \n as a sports city. An NBA doubleheader featuring four different teams, three locks for the 2012 Olympic team (Kobe, CP3 and Blake), five future Hall of Famers (Kobe, KG, Allen, Pierce and Gasol), the leagues most famous rivalry (Lakers-Celtics), the leagues most entertaining team (the Clippers) and the leagues most lovably tortured franchise (the Warriors)?\nQuick tangent: I moved to Los Angeles in November 2002 and always assumed I would be gone by now. There are probably two dozen reasons why I havent left yet and why I may never leave, but the most underrated one? Having two NBA teams playing 20 minutes from my house. I bought Clippers season tickets in 2004 and probably attend 25 games per season. I dont attend nearly as many Lakers games, if only because being around 18,000 Lakers fans gives me the same sinking feeling that one of the \n survivors has when theyre trapped in a school bus or a barn with zombies banging against it. But thats fine -- I like knowing I can go anytime I want. I like that LeBron and Kevin Durant come twice as many times; that I have double the chance to catch a must-see rookie (like Kyrie Irving or Ricky Rubio this season). At this point, I cant imagine having it any other way.\nOccasionally, theres a day like yesterday, when everything falls into place and Los Angeles feels like the capital of the basketball world. The Lakers and Celtics started things off with one of those exhausting battles that brought back memories of \"Hearns-Leonard III\" or \"Ward-Gatti III\" -- you know, the third act of one of those boxing trilogies in which both boxers arent remotely the same anymore, but its still fun to watch them beat the hell out of each other. The Lakers have managed to remain competitive with three elite players and nine guys who range from \"below-average\" to \"somebody needs to drive you to the NBA vet and put you down.\" I dont think theres ever been an NBA roster quite like it. Its like making a $200 million blockbuster movie with Will Smith, Charlize Theron and Ryan Gosling  then casting people off the street for every other role. I picked them to finish 34-32, assuming there was no way Kobe, Gasol AND Bynum could stay healthy during a condensed schedule. Wrong. Improbably, theyre contending for the no. 3 seed in the West while steadfastly avoiding any crippling injuries. Nobody thinks the Lakers can win the title  then again, nobody wants to play them in the playoffs.\nThe Celtics havent been as lucky: They lost Jeff Green for the year and Jermaine ONeal and Chris Wilcox recently, although you could argue they lost those guys the moment they signed them. They went into yesterdays Lakers showdown with Kevin Garnett, Brandon Bass, Greg Stiemsma and JaJuan Johnson as their only bigs. Yikes. I cant remember the last Lakers-Celtics game that featured so many players ranging from \"mediocre\" to \"downright useless\": Keyon Dooling, Stiemsma, Sasha Pavlovic, Avery Bradley, Derek Fisher, Troy Murphy, Andrew Goudelock, Matt Barnes, Josh McRoberts  I mean, those were 45 percent of the guys who played, and I didnt even include Mickael Pietrus, Metta World Peace or Steve Blake (or the four guys who didnt play). Its a shame they didnt make this a \"Losing GM Leaves Town\" match.\nA normally lively crowd of Celtics haters didnt even wake up until halftime -- when the Red Panda Acrobat wheeled out on her unicycle and flipped bowls onto her head -- then finally got involved after a Pierce/Peace/Garnett skirmish in the third that almost seemed contrived by all three to get the crowd going. By the fourth quarter, it felt like a playoff game: The Lakers were pounding Boston inside but couldnt handle Rondos speed in transition (or his general youd-be-crazy-to-trade-me brilliance). Kobe nailed two huge 3s midway through the fourth right as Boston was trying to pull away, then another big jumper after Ray Allens 3 had put Boston up five with 2:41 to play. The Celtics never scored again. On the biggest play of the game (up one, under 40 seconds left), Boston tried for a two-for-one possession and ran a perfect play, getting Brandon Bass a wide-open 17-footer that hed been draining all game. He missed it. The Lakers pounded it inside to Bynum for the clinching hoop and that was that.\nThe lesson, as always: When youre running the biggest play of the game for Brandon Bass, youre probably a no. 8 seed. By the way, I knew the Celtics were in trouble when I noticed Tom Brady sitting courtside. Anytime Brady and I are in the same building, something traumatic happens. We need to go to couples therapy or something.  I dont want to talk about this game anymore.\nMy friend Chen (fellow Lakers hater) and I quickly scampered out of the building and drove to The Greatest Chinese Food Restaurant Ever to eat away our sorrows. (I cant tell you the name, or where it is. Its like \n. Youll never get the name out of me. Even if you waterboard me.) Just know that I gained three pounds from this meal. Ninety minutes later and loaded with MSG, I caught a ride back to Staples and reentered the suddenly Clippers-friendly arena. How do they turn the building over that fast AND clean it AND fumigate the stink of Lakers fans? Its a great question.\nLike everyone else in attendance, I assumed the Clippers would cruise to an easy victory because (a) they were kicking off a six-game homestand, (b) Stephen Curry sprained his ankle for the 755th time, (c) the Warriors played the night before, and (d) the Clippers have more talent than the Warriors. But when Dorell Wright starts making 3s (four in the first quarter!!!) and the Clippers start bricking free throws (16 in all)? All bets are off. Hey, you know a bad playoff recipe? Poor free throw shooting and bad coaching. I have been following the NBA since I was 4 years old -- if the Clippers 2012 destiny isnt losing a Round 1 or Round 2 playoff series in the most excruciating way possible, then I dont know anything.\nThe real problem is Vinny Del Negro was hired before the 2010-11 season by Clippers owner/skinflint/slumlord Donald Sterling because the Bulls were paying half of Del Negros salary. You get what you pay for. \n, I dont think the Clippers necessarily need to fire Vinny -- they can simply demote him to assistant, or add him as the third man in the TV booth. He doesnt need to go away entirely. He just needs to, you know, stop being the head coach.\nEvery game, Vinny does at least one thing that makes you think, \n Last night, he waited waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long to play his energy guys (Reggie Evans and Eric Bledsoe) with the game slipping away (an 18-point deficit) in front of a comatose/semi-horrified crowd. When he finally played the Evans/Bledsoe card and they brought the Clips back (and woke up the fans), Vinny missed multiple chances to sub his best player (Chris Paul, also one of the best players alive) for an ice-cold Mo Williams (1-for-8) midway through the fourth, finally pulling the trigger with just 3:18 remaining in a tie game after Paul had been sitting for a solid half hour. Inexplicable. You would have thought dozens of \"PUT CHRIS IN!\" cries would shake Vinny out of his stupor, but no. The Clippers couldnt finish down the stretch, and that was that. Yet another annoying loss for a team that should be running away with the Pacific and somehow is allowing the Lakers to hang around. Aaaargh.\nI left the building mildly impressed by the Warriors (for a lottery team, they play their butts off and dont have any dogs, although Currys ankle problems continue to be perplexing), mildly discouraged by the Clippers (who just cant seem to stay out of their own way some nights) and unequivocally delighted by the doubleheader of hoops (two NBA games in nine hours!). Only in Los Angeles.\nThe good news for Clippers fans: They get to play an almost-definitely-dead-legged-and-shorthanded Celtics team tonight.\nThe good news for Celtics fans: Between Vinny and the Clippers foul shooting malaise, youre always in any Clipper game.\nThe good news for me: Three games in 32 hours! Say what you want about Los Angeles, but in 2012, its the professional basketball capital of the world. Until tomorrow."}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/20302/28-days-later-re-throning-of-the-kings", "blog_text": "Buying season tickets for the L.A. Kings seemed like a good idea during the NBA lockout. It seemed like a great idea in November when there was no basketball, if only because our seats are directly behind one of the goals, and lemme tell you something, there is \n quite like sitting behind the net at a hockey game. You learn to respect goaltenders (hardest job in sports, hands down); the speed of the game (ridiculous); the sensation of a puck speeding toward your face that gets abruptly stopped by the glass (only you dont realize its been stopped until you hear that gunshot-like sound that stops your heart for a second); and how relentlessly physical professional hockey is (and also, how freaking tough those guys are). There was definitely a \"new car smell\" to those first few games behind the pipes. I loved them.\nOnce the NBA season started after Christmas, Kings season tickets started to seem less and less of a good idea -- but not for the reasons youd think. For over three months, the Kings were really, really, \n boring to watch. They didnt have a discernible identity -- you wouldnt call them old, young, good, bad, fast, tough, plodding, lazy, anything. They didnt fight, didnt bang bodies, didnt score, didnt do anything except play games that ended 1-0 or 2-1. Their best player? Goaltender Jonathan Quick. Thats all you need to know.\nThese games werent just boring because of the lack of goals; hockey is all about creating \n to score, and sometimes those chances are more fun than the goals themselves. The Kings sucked the life out of the crowd because they never really made us feel like a goal might be coming. They just looked like a bunch of guys skating around. Hold on, I have some non-advanced metrics for you: Heading into last night, the Kings had scored 154 goals in 69 games, which averages out to barely two a game (second-lowest in the league). Thanks to Quick, they gave up 145 goals in those 69 games (third-best in the league). Add both numbers together and every Kings game featured about 4.2 goals and 235.3 yawns.\nTheir best offensive player was and is Anze Kopitar, affectionately called \"Kopie\" by Kings fans  probably a good thing because everyone mangles the Yugoslavian pronunciation of \"Anze.\" Hes one of those highly skilled centers with quick hands who always seems about two-fifths of a second ahead of everyone else. You wouldnt call him a sniper, or a Milan Lucic-type power forward, or even a physical specimen like Evgeni Malkin (the best player Ive caught in person this season, by far). Hes just exceptionally polished. Hes slightly better at face-offs than everyone else. His shots and passes are slightly better. He skates slightly faster and handles the puck slightly better. Even my 6-year-old daughter -- who knew nothing about hockey until her first game in November and now enjoys going so much that Im resigned to meeting a steady stream of boyfriends from 2018 through 2030 who smell like stale hockey equipment -- demanded a Kopie jersey within two periods under the always-defensible \"little kids are front-runners\" corollary. Little kids always gravitate to the best players. Its just one of their talents, right up there with being blunt and being able to eat multiple desserts without throwing up.\nStill, youd never call Kopie dominant (hes not even in the top 20 for points), and when Mike Richards (their big summer import) turned out to be good (not great), everyone knew the Kings were one impact scorer short. Making matters worse: They played with a general lethargy that made you say, \"I dont know enough about hockey to know when a team should fire its coach, but wow, it sure feels like the Kings should fire their coach.\" Sure enough, they fired Terry Murray a few weeks ago and replaced him with one of the 25 Sutter brothers. Suddenly we were treated to more fights, more checks, more chippiness and just about everything else that makes hockey more fun to watch  except, you know, goals.\nBy February, it started to look like the Kings might miss the playoffs by a point or two. A worst-case scenario for their season-ticket holders, obviously. Saying theres a difference between hockeys regular season and postseason is like saying theres a difference between dry-humping and actual sex. Just when I was starting to lose hope of seeing a playoff game, they traded defenseman Jack Johnson and a no. 1 pick for forward Jeff Carter, the former Philly star who had been struggling on a lousy Columbus team. That just shows you how desperate the Kings were -- as recently as October, Johnson, Kopitar, Quick and Drew Doughty were considered the foundation of a potential Cup contender. (Important note: I never understood everyones fascination with Johnson. I probably saw him play 12 times and rarely if ever \n him. That cant be a good sign. And dont get me started on Doughty.) Everyone hoped Carter would re-create some of his old Philly magic with Richards (his former teammate). But you never know until you see it.\nDuring an eventual 5-2 victory over the Red Wings Tuesday night, I finally caught Carter in person. He stood out for a variety of reasons: He wears the no. 77 jersey (a number that just pops); hes bigger than every relevant King except Kopitar and fan unfavorite Dustin Penner (who might be made of Krispy Kreme); hes one of those natural scoring predators who circles the net with extra purpose; hes a much smarter passer than I expected (hockeys like basketball -- the good passers just jump out at you); he kills penalties (something this casual hockey fan didnt expect); and basically, you notice him every time hes skating around. Thats an underrated quality for an 82-game season, if only because every team needs a couple of guys who make you say, \"Hey, its that guy! He might do something!\" just to keep you on your toes. Carter also tipped the scales for the Kings in this respect: Now that they have two scoring lines, its easier for them to score (glad Im here to point this out) and creates a different level of pressure.\nHeres the thing: Hockey is both complicated and astonishingly simple. Its really about pressure over time. (Copyright: Andy Dufresnes rock hammer.) You try to create as many quality scoring chances as possible, as consistently as possible, while preventing as many quality scoring chances as possible. (Again, Im not breaking ground here. Bear with me.) Youre riding the percentages, almost like poker on ice. Before Carter, the Kings only seemed dangerous on a power play or if Kopitar was skating around. You could actually see opposing goalies perk up specifically for those two situations. But Carters addition made everything fall into place -- for the first time, the Kings felt complete to me. Their nightly fate didnt just directly hinge on Kopie, Quick and the referees.\nEven my daughter noticed. I told her to check out the new guy right before the opening face-off and didnt mention him again. In the second period, as I was plowing through an Oreo McFlurry (the most underrated dessert out there) and she was annihilating a cheery Icee (totally overrated), she mumbled through frozen red vampire lips, \"I like the new guy!\"\n\"Seventy-seven?\"\n\"Yeah. Hes really good.\"\n\"Uh-oh. Youre not trading in your Kopie jersey for 77, are you?\"\n\"What does trading in mean?\"\n\"I mean, youre not getting rid of your Kopie jersey for a 77 --\"\n\"DAD!!!! Id never get rid of Kopie!\"\n\"Thats good. Im glad youre loyal.\"\n[\n]\n\"But maybe we could get a 77 jersey and I could rotate them or something?\"\nCongratulations, Jeff Carter  you passed the Daughter Test. Now get the Kings an 8-seed so I can take her to a playoff game, please."}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/23431/28-days-later-pushing-around-the-kings", "blog_text": "The L.A. Kings blew a chance to clinch their division (and a no. 3 seed) Thursday night, losing a shootout at home to San Jose. Those two teams play again on Saturday night, in San Jose, with the winner getting the no. 3 seed and the loser getting the no. 7 seed. (Late note after we posted: Apparently Phoenix can win the division as well by winning its last two games. Im not too concerned because, again, its Phoenix.) None of this really matters because seeds dont matter in hockey -- anybody can beat anybody anywhere at anytime -- but for the die-hards sitting in my section, it mattered for two reasons.\n The no. 3 seed potentially means an extra playoff game (Game 7, no less). Like everyone else who bought Kings playoff tickets, I wanted that extra game. Badly. I was rooting for the Kings like they were a Boston team last night.\n I know this sounds impossible, but in 44 years, the Kings have only captured \n division title. They even put up a banner in Staples Center for it. Is there a better way to prove your fans have been tortured than hanging division banners, or even worse, having one of those fans say during a game, \"We need to get that banner?\" (And yes, I heard someone say that last night.)\nSo last nights battle against the Sharks felt like a de facto playoff game. You can always judge the chippiness of any hockey game by the number of times after a goalie freezes the puck when an opposing forward does the \"go an extra couple of feet and abruptly stops right in front of the goalie just in case the puck falls out\" move, then at least one opponent whacks him in the face and they do the whole \"Hey, what was that????\" staredown/shoving/sarcastic swearing routine. The Kings and Sharks did that after just about every whistle.\nIt turned out to be the weirdest Kings game I attended all year: 10 goals, three fights and one dumbfounding moment. Late in the third period, with the Kings pressing on a power play and Jarrett Stoll flying up the ice on a two-on-one, the evil Ryane Clowe (a bearded bully on the Sharks who had already scored a goal and won two fights) broke up the breakaway by \n. This wouldnt have been a big deal except, you know, CLOWE WAS SITTING ON THE BENCH AT THE TIME!!!! Did all four referees miss him doing this? Of course they did. After the 75th time they replayed it on the video screen, everyone knew the Kings would lose because thats just how hockey works -- when you get screwed over on something like that, theres no bouncing back. Their pathetic goose egg in the ensuing shootout was almost preordained.\nOf course, that wasnt my biggest takeaway from Thursdays game. Like always, the Kings got their asses kicked in all three fights. I grew up watching Terry OReilly, Stan Jonathan, John Wensink, Wayne Cashman, Al Secord and everyone else on the Big Bad Bruins, a team that fought so much, they even climbed into the MSG stands once to fight Rangers fans. The Bruins always know how to scrap; its been that way for my entire life, and really, you couldnt have it any other way in Boston. So its been disorienting to watch the Kings keep getting beaten up. Thursday night, \n that we were watching it the same way Apollo Creeds wife watched the Drago fight. A little bit later, Clowe jumped Matt Greene and \n. In the second period, Cloweavenged a Kyle Clifford five-minute boarding penalty by \n. After that, the Kings decided to stop fighting the Sharks.\nWas it a coincidence that the Sharks rallied back from a 3-1 hole after winning those three fights? Maybe, maybe not. After Clowe beat Clifford, he was skating to the penalty box and turned around to sarcastically shrug to the Kings bench, as if to say, \"You guys are wimps.\" And to a certain degree, that might be true. Theyre a finesse team with one pseudo-enforcer, Kevin Westgarth, whos been a healthy scratch since February 16. Clifford, Greene and Colin Fraser throw down with little success. Thats about it.\nAccording to \n, the Kings have been involved in \n. If youve never been to that site before, its like Rotten Tomatoes crossed with YouTube for hockey fights -- not only do they post clips for EVERY fight, their users even vote for the winners. (By the way, if you had told 1980 Billy Simmons that, some day, he would be able to watch any hockey fight that happened and vote for the winner, his head would have exploded.) Just for fun, I tallied up the Kings voting results. They started the season with two wins, six draws and no losses. From there, things went downhill with a 3-20-2 cold streak that included the Kings losing their last \n fights. They havent won a fight at home since Mike Richards beat Phoenixs Martin Hanzal on February 16. Trust me, I went to that game -- it wasnt exactly an ass-whupping.\nMight 3-20-2 be a bad postseason omen? The NHL playoffs are all about picking scabs -- you look for any weakness you can find, and once you find it, you just start picking away at it. The Kings have a well-balanced team with an outstanding goalie, and they chase the puck pretty relentlessly (at least lately). But you can push them around, and if you want to make a cheap run at Kopitar, Quick or anyone else, you definitely dont have to worry about someone making you pay. After sitting through half of their home games this season, thats their biggest flaw (that I can see, anyway).\nFor instance, the Bruins have a respected enforcer (Shawn Thornton), but they also have Zdeno Chara, Milan Lucic, Gregory Campbell, Adam McQuaid  \n. Whenever Im watching the Bruins and someone gets chippy with them, you know they wont stand for it (and if anything, theyll embrace it). You cant say the same about the Kings. Nobody captures their identity better than Dustin Penner, their frustrating 6-foot-3 forward whos evolved into something of a whipping boy for the Kings faithful. One of the biggest guys on the team, Penner barely throws checks, much less punches. Every time he wades into the corner and goes through the motions of not hitting someone, you hear this chorus of pissed-off \"COME ON, PENNER!\" hisses coming from every direction. Its actually taken a life of its own, at least in my section, where fans instinctively yell \"COME ON, PENNER!\" at other Kings who dont finish checks. Strangely, all of this makes me root for Penner -- I always want him to do well, just because its funny when he scores and the fans instantly flip that switch and pretend to be Penner fans again. But if youre trying to win the Cup? You need less Penners and more Ryane Clowe.\nYou know who summed it up best? My 6-year old daughter, who has somehow attended a whopping 14 Kings games this season and wants to marry Anze Kopitar. (I wish I were making that up.) We were watching the Zamboni drive around between the second and third periods last night when she suddenly piped up, \"Hey, daddy, why doesnt someone teach the Kings how to fight?\" Lets hope that doesnt become the epitaph for their 2012 season."}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/25067/heavy-are-the-arms-that-lift-the-cup", "blog_text": "At some point last night, I tweeted that sudden death of Game 7 in hockey was like chain-smoking cigarettes while doing cocaine bumps and sitting on the \n toilet. I have only done one of those three things. I was just guessing. But playoff hockey is a different animal, and when your entire season hinges on a series of bounces, rebounds and deflections that just keep coming and coming, the experience ceases to be entertaining and morphs into something much darker. You dont watch sudden death of a Game 7; you endure it. Theres just nothing like it.\nDeep down, Capitals fans and Bruins fans knew Game 7 in Boston was probably coming down to overtime. The other six games had been decided by one goal apiece. You didnt exactly need a Magic 8-Ball to figure this baby out. And so Bostons title defense came down to the same excruciating, chew-your-toenails-because-you-have-no-fingernails heart-pounder that the Bruins kept pulling out last spring on the way to their first Cup in 39 years. Sometimes in the playoffs, you reach a certain level when two opponents realize theyre relatively even, when neither of them can possibly try any harder  and then, it comes down to hustle and luck. Last nights hasty overtime came down to two rebounds: Bostons Patrice Bergeron missing his chance because of a bouncing puck, then Washingtons Joel Ward coming through two minutes later. Thats hockey for you. Boston had a slightly better team; Washington had a slightly better goalie. It was a coin flip.\nAhhhhhhh, the goalies. Last spring, \n. This spring, he left the lights on two or three times a game. Even if neither of Wednesday nights goals were his fault, he played just poorly enough in the other games to keep the Caps hanging around. As the years pass and memories cloud, people will remember Thomass goofy White House snub in late January serving as a tipping point of sorts -- in other words, the Bruins were heading for a repeat until Thomas screwed up the whole thing.\nThats not totally what happened. The Bruins battled the infamous Cup hangover coming out of the gate, dropping seven of their first 10, then ripping off one of the best streaks in franchise history: 24 games, 21 wins, three losses (one by shootout). I cant remember any Bruins team playing like \n before. They had me devotedly watching regular-season hockey for the first time since grad school. There was one jaw-dropping stretch before Christmas when they won 6-0 in Philly, beat their archrival Canadiens at home, then topped it off by beating a quality Panthers team 8-0. Eight to nothing! The Bruins were outscoring teams \n beating them up. They had three lines who could score, four defensemen you could trust, two goalies averaging fewer than two goals allowed per game  oh, and they could manhandle you. I attended a Kings-Bruins game in March, well after that scorching streak had fizzled out, when the Bruins were so much more physical than the Kings that it almost didnt seem fair. They pounded the Kings in the corners, knocked them around and basically laid the smack down. You would have thought they were winning 10-0  and looking back, maybe that they barely eked out a 4-2 victory (capped off by a late empty-netter) wasnt the greatest sign.\nJust dont blame the White House (and the admittedly kooky Washington symmetry) for Bostons season inadvertently peaking in December. Blame Nathan Hortons season-ending concussion on January 22 -- from that point on, Bostons offense just never felt as potent. Blame the upper-body injury that claimed reliable defenseman Adam McQuaid for Round 1, which meant Greg Zanon and Joe Corvo played more than anyone wanted. Blame Bergerons mystery injury from Game 5, which clearly hampered him in the final two games (and maybe caused him to blow that overtime rebound). Blame backup Tuukka Rasks knee injury putting the seasons weight entirely on Thomas (38 years old, by the way). Blame Washington rookie Braden Holtby for harkening the ghost of Steve Penney for two solid weeks. Blame Bostons lousy power play, which disappeared even more egregiously than it did last spring (when it nearly cost them the title). Most of all, blame hockey. This is what happens with defending champs: They kill themselves to win a Cup, celebrate all summer, let down a little, regroup, prove theyre great again, and then, its really up to the whims of the season itself. Sometimes they go your way, sometimes they dont.\nQuick story: I attended 22 Kings games (and counting) this season and sat directly behind one of the nets. Almost immediately, I found myself becoming fascinated by the quirkiness of goalies. Theres something extremely OCD-ish about that position; its all about sticking to a semi-insane routine, whether its stretching the same way during the same points of every game, sipping water the same number of times every time, even tapping the goal posts in some creepy order during every break. Maybe facing 35-40 shots a game with forwards repeatedly crashing the net like semitrucks drives you toward the sanctity of those OCD routines. Maybe theyre bonkers to begin with. Regardless, its a fragile position played by seemingly fragile people. People who cant allow themselves to rest for a second.\nWell, except for Tim Thomas.\nOf all the goalies I caught in person this season, he was the only one who didnt seem flummoxed by the pressure. If anything, he carried himself more like a professional golfer. He barely did any of the OCD stuff, just some easy stretching to stay loose. He conversed with linesmen during breaks and seemed to be genuinely amused by the Ice Girls. Sometimes when he pulled off his mask to grab a drink, hed stare into our section and check out the fans (with a friendly look on his face, no less). One time, he did something that I never saw any other goalie do -- as players fought for the puck on the other end, Thomas rested his right arm on the crossbar and \n. For a few seconds, he just hung out and watched the game with us -- happily playing the role of \"The Guy Who Won Last Years Cup and Fully Expects to Win Again.\" The champs were in the house. And acting like it.\nLooking back, that moment summed up the season. The Bruins were good and they knew it. They fully expected things to work out their way; thats what happened last year, thats what would happen this year. Of course, the Hockey Gods had other ideas. Theres a reason no NHL champ has repeated since the 98 Red Wings; its hard to be good AND lucky for two straight years. As last night proved, a second straight Cup just wasnt meant to be. My friend Sean Grande \n: \"That was a great title defense for the Bruins. They wore the belt well.\" And they did.\nLast note: After the game abruptly ended, a few idiot Bruins fans tweeted racial slurs because Ward (an African-Canadian) scored the game-winning goal. Those morons dont reflect on the city of Boston, but rather the Internet itself -- an occasionally unseemly place with little accountability that willingly courts hateful morons from every corner of the world. Over the years, I have gotten e-mails from \"readers\" hoping that Id die in a fire and (fill in any other horrible scenario). I dont even blink when I see that stuff anymore. Its just part of life on the Internet. If you dont believe me, spend an hour reading YouTube comments some time. Just because last night became Bostons spin on the Hateful Idiot Internet Wheel doesnt mean some larger connection needs to be made, even if it may have fit neatly into a once-popular (and increasingly unfair) stereotype of Boston that stopped being true long ago. Its not 1974 any more. Those assholes didnt represent Boston, but rather the underbelly of the Internet itself. Theres a difference."}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/32156/53-day-warning-drew-brees-signed", "blog_text": "Now that were a mere 53 days away from the start of the 2012 \n NFL season, I have some good news for you ... Drew Brees signed a \n!!!!!! Why did that deserve six exclamation points? Well ...\n\n\n\n\n One of the dumbest ongoing sports stories is finally over. I hate any sports story that doesnt lend itself to an argument or at least two fairly interesting opinions. Why wouldnt the Saints take care of Brees? What took them so long? What were they doing? They couldnt say, \"Well, they never won a Super Bowl with him,\" because they did. They couldnt say, \"Well, he doesnt really mean that much to our franchise or our city,\" because he does. They couldnt say, \"He stopped throwing up monster fantasy seasons,\" because he never stopped. They couldnt say, \"Well, the Mannings and Brady didnt get taken care of, either,\" because they did. They couldnt say, \"We dont really need the good publicity or the good will with our fans,\" because post-Bountygate, they clearly did. They couldnt say, \"If only \n could be a little longer,\" because they always are. So what was happening here? Shit, the Bensons BOUGHT AN NBA TEAM during the time they could have been taking care of Brees. I remain confused.\n Brees was headed for the first defensible contract holdout in the recent history of team sports. When does that ever happen? Did you really want to sit around with your friends saying, \"Yeah, I dont blame Brees at all, playing for $16 million this season would have been totally insulting.\"\n Did you really want to read fantasy football previews that had an asterisk next to Brees? Did you really want to do Chase Daniel research? Did you really want some asshole in your league to take a fourth-round flier on Brees, then luck out five days later when Brees signed? Or conversely, did you really want to pick Brees, then have him torture you for the first weeks of the season?\n The bad news: They announced the contract on Friday the 13th. Thats a terrible idea. I wouldnt even buy one of those 27-inch LCD TVs from those weird companies that youve never heard of at Best Buy on Friday the 13th.\n The good news: Breess contract guarantees him $60 million ... a million less than the Nets guaranteed Brook Lopez this week. I think this cancels out the Friday the 13th thing -- when youre paying your franchise QB a million less than the \"good\" Lopez, you have to feel good about that.\n Whats worse than reading about someones contract holdout every day? Even the hideous Dwight Howard trade quagmire is more fun -- at least there, you can enjoy derisive Internet nicknames like \"Dwight Coward\" or derisive headlines like \"Dwightmare\"; you can make up fake trades for hours on end; you can watch Daryl Morey keep adding assets and doing everything but open a www.dwightorbust.com website; you can make jokes like \"any time you can give up every asset you have AND take on multiple bad contracts for a wishy-washy guy coming off back surgery who doesnt want to play for you and can easily leave in 11 months, you have to do it\"; and you get to hear Chris Broussard and Stephen A. Smith drag out the word \"Daaaaaah-wight\" for five or six seconds at a time. Contract holdouts arent nearly as much fun.\nActually, theres never been a fun contract holdout -- not ever, not once -- that I can remember. Just two seconds ago, I asked everyone at the Grantland office, \"Has there ever been a fun contract holdout in sports?,\" and everyone looked at me the same way they would have had I just dropped my pants and taken a deuce on Dave Jacobys desk. \n So thanks to the goofy but lovable Benson family, thanks to Brees and his agent, and thanks to the Saints fans for whatever real and telepathic pressure they applied to get their franchise guy paid. We can wipe one totally annoying football story off the books. Fifty-three days to go."}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/34485/russia-cant-stop-the-reign-of-spain", "blog_text": "Explain this one to me: The Olympics organizers probably gave away $300,000 of revenue per basketball session by not having courtside seats, and yet they scheduled Fridays mens basketball semifinals so that \nA. Spain and Russia played at 5 p.m. London time as the \"early\" game.\nB. Everyone in the stadium then had to leave.\nC. They cleaned the stadium.\nD. America and Argentina played the \"night\" game at 9 p.m. for a new crowd.\nSounds super greedy, right? And yet  they surrounded all four sides of the court with empty space? Dont worry, it was even dumber in person. Speaking of dumb, I should probably mention that Spain nearly blew the semifinal because Russia said, \"Hey, were going to swarm the Gasol brothers every time they get the ball, do you have a Plan B?\" In the first half, the answer was \"No!\" And then everything changed, shots started falling, an inside-outside game materialized and Spain banged out an eight-point victory (and the silver medal at worst).\nThings looked grim for them at halftime, when Russia was leading 31-20 and the Spaniards had missed 23 of 29 shots. Their only silver lining was a funky performance by Russias best player, Andrei Kirilenko, who was playing with the confidence of someone whose life had just been threatened by Russian mobsters before the game. Just kidding. But man, as someone who still plays basketball and knows that \"I cant make a shot, this is humiliating, I want to shoot myself\" feeling a little too intimately, I recognized the dismay on his face pretty early. Theres nothing worse than going ice-cold on a basketball court. Especially when 12,000 people are watching and youre letting an entire country down. Did he open the door for me to keep making fun of that $20 million contract that Minnesota gave him? Actually, yeah! Its a little ajar again. Im excited.\nAnyway, when Spain made their belated surge in the second half -- fueled by that inside-outside game that should have started an hour earlier, as well as six monster 3s from Jose Calderon and Rudy Fernandez -- Russia had nowhere to go with Kirilenko floundering. Sergey Monya had already made his three 3s; it wasnt like he was pulling a \"Dan Majerle in the 1993 Finals\" on us. Hes Sergey Monya, for Gods sake. Timofey Mozgov couldnt get anything done down low against the Gasol \n. (Ill pass on the punchline there.) Playmaker Alexey Shved was submitting a full-fledged, deer-in-the-headlights no-show (and throwing a big bucket of water on every writer claiming that he was going to \n). Viktor played like total Khryapa, missing five of six shots. (Sorry, I had to.) So who was left other than old Kansas friend Sasha Kaun (14 garbage points) and Kirilenko (2-for-12 shooting, five missed free throws)?\nOnce the Spaniards realized nobody on Russia could hurt them, that was that -- they started flying around on defense and draining 3s, delighting their contingent of singing/chanting/jumping Spanish fans. (I hate to keep banging this point home, but we really need to work on the whole cheering thing in America.) Spain even covered the six-point spread by two, much to the dismay of everyone who waltzed into a \n before the game and threw down money on the Russians. (If youre wondering, I held off.) I spent most of Spains comeback feeling bad for Serge Ibaka, who was pretending to be just as happy as the other bench guys, only you could see the \"Really? I played crunch time in the NBA Finals but I cant get 10 minutes of run for the Spanish national team?\" thought bubble floating above him. This would have been the weirdest subplot of the game if not for the writer sitting on press row who \n during the second half. Does this stuff always happen on press row? I might have to sit there more often.\nSo what needs to happen for Spain to beat America on Sunday? First, they need to use the Gasols to draw double teams and find open shooters; if America tries to defend them one-on-one, then Spain should pound them down low. (Sounds simple on paper. Wont be simple with dudes like LeBron, Durant and Westbrook flying around.) Second, they need to play Sergio Llull more. Hes a fearless energy guy (think Sasha Vujacic four years ago, only better and more likable) as well as their best all-around guard (its true), only they keep splitting his minutes with a banged-up Juan-Carlos Navarro. (If they play Llull enough minutes on Sunday, hes a mortal lock to piss Kobe off at least three times. For that alone, they should play him.) Third, they need to play poor Ibaka more than 6.33 minutes -- the exact number he played Russia, as amazing as that sounds -- because theyre going to need his athleticism against Team USA. And fourth, they need to make 50 percent of their 3s, something they pulled off against Russia in the second half  so on paper, we know they can do it.\nCan they beat us? Well, theyre too slow without Rubio -- their perimeter guys cant play slash-and-kick OR get to the rim (and remember, USA doesnt protect the rim that well), which puts too much pressure on their big guys to create everything. The Gasol \nwould have to combine for something like 50 points, foul out Tyson Chandler \n Kevin Love and basically wreak havoc to steal the gold. Im not saying its impossible  but its certainly not realistic, and thats before throwing in the \"making 50 percent of their 3s\" part. Honestly, Im much more afraid of Argentina tonight, especially because I probably just jinxed Team USA by sending in this blog post and assuming that wed win. Dont judge me -- I wrote this thing in 22 minutes. Now if youll excuse me, I have to go find a burrito and eat half of it before throwing the other half away and feeling sick afterward. More on Monday.

I already whined about this in our \n of the YouTube Hall of Fame, but still, how could our staff (who voted for the seeds) overlook the funniest sequel ever made? You cant even blame a post-\n backlash against Mike Myers, because \n (a total cash grab littered with now-dated pop culture references and a dated-at-the-time \n homage) somehow sneaked into the bracket over \n (a superior sequel in every conceivable way). They made \n in about three minutes! Its one of those movies in which you can tell they were frantically writing scenes on cocktail napkins right before they filmed them. And we \n it???\n(My theory: The massive success of the \n franchise became counterproductive from a \"coolness\" standpoint. The same thing happened to \n, actually -- once recognizable movie lines enter the mainstream and your 61-year-old uncle or accounting professor thinks its funny to make jokes in Borats or Austin Powerss accent, its almost unrecoverable.)\nRunner-up choice: I thought \n was one of the most original sequels ever made, but Im admittedly a sucker for \"catch up with the same characters a decade later after theyre much more jaded and beaten down\" sequels. (You easily could have talked me into \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n for the same reason.) The only reason \n didnt make it? During the L.A. voting, noted romantic cynic Jay Kang bullied everyone off their original votes by unleashing his deadly Jay Kang Sarcastic Cackle and trolling the movie for about 20 seconds. People got scared off. I blame Kang. And by the way, hes the same guy who gave \n his highest possible score. See how flawed this process was?\nSG: Yeah, but still.\nSG: \n was better than \n ... only one of the most successful movies ever made. This seems relevant. We should have included \n if only because were probably \n when his contracts up -- not picking \n for Rembert was a bigger slap in the face than the Celtics nearly trading Ray Allen last February. (And look how that turned out.) Our movie nerds flipped out that \n missed the cut -- including our ESPN Films buddy Dan Silver, the biggest movie dork I know and one of those guys who would literally drop dead of a heart attack if you looked him in the eye and told him that you genuinely believed \n was a better movie than \n. The second \n movie was considered one of the best sequels ever made for years and years ... and eventually, everyone forgot this. Especially our voters. (I blame Mel Gibson.) \n revived that franchise, made a bazillion dollars, guaranteed that theyd be making those movies every 18 months for the rest of our lives, and led to one of my favorite B.S. Report breakdowns (with \n). You could make the case that \n was the second best trilogy ever made, and that BOTH sequels could have made it. And frankly, Ill never forgive myself for not remembering to nominate \n for \n, and especially this one.\nSG: After we failed America by including a generic action movie like \n, I was delighted when \n trounced \n in Round 1 with four times the votes. Al Pacinos cringe-worthy performance in \n should have eliminated it from consideration just out of principle. And God bless the \n franchise, but its hard to think of them as \"movies\" rather than as insane YouTube videos strung together into an 80-minute glob. If theres a way to drug-test the 539 people who voted for \n over \n on Round 1, Id like to explore it.\nSG: \n easily bringing down \n on Day 4. You cant even say \n was penalized by being an 80s movie, because \n was an 80s movie. Im 45 percent sure that a totally baked Harrison Ford spent four hours stuffing the ballot.\nSG: Probably during the voting session for L.A. staffers. I suggested \n and nearly got laughed out of the room, followed by Robert Mays saying, \"You dont understand, my generation doesnt CARE about Michael Myers.\" That one really stung. (Fortunately, I oversee Mayss yearly Disney review -- so its not like I cant get my revenge.) \n was a cleverly written sequel that revived a moribund franchise (no, really -- it made $55 million), jump-started Josh Hartnett and Michelle Williamss movie careers (fine, it went 1-for-2 there), proved that LL Cool J wasnt just the \"Mama Said Knock You Out\" rapper (youre right, Im reaching), and erased the stink of \n 3 through 6. It also allowed the\n junkies (Im one of them) to pretend that those four movies never happened, and that Jamie Lee Curtiss three movies (1, 2 and H2O) were unofficially the \ntrilogy. \nLemme flip this around for you: Whos the most famous Hollywood murderer ever? Either Michael Myers or Jason, right? Well ... did it make sense that they were only represented in Sequeltology twice? Didnt think so. \n\nSG: Were still trying to figure this out. It happened organically during a \n, when we were trying to determine sequel rules and everyone just kinda went with it. When \n says, \"I want to become the Sequel Czar,\" you dont stand in his way.\n\nSG: Nope. Only because we dont know who made the mistake. (Everyone is still passing the buck and blaming other staffers.) Im just biding my time and waiting until the right moment -- probably the Grantland Christmas party, after theres been some distance and everyone has thrown down a few drinks -- to find out what really happened. Rule No. 1 for Totally Contrived Internet Brackets: \"When You Have Two Overwhelmingly Heavy Favorites, Make Sure They Meet in the Finals.\" If this were sports, youd wonder if that epic semifinals battle took too much out of \n and left the door open for a finals upset. But guess what? Its not sports. Its a totally contrived Internet bracket.\n\nSG: Heading into this process, I just assumed \n would cruise to the title for a variety of reasons, including:\nAnd look -- you could make a really good case that \n was the best movie of the 2000s. (I argued in 2009 that \n was the \n of the 2000s, but theres a difference between \"best\" and \"rewatchable.\") We wont totally know until theres the right amount of distance -- maybe 20 years or so -- when the impact of Heath Ledgers death fades a little, when we can judge the movie for what it was, and most important, when Maggie Gyllenhaals lousy performance takes on a life of its own. One of the great things about \n? You can watch it over and over again for 40 solid years without finding any real flaws. Its an impeccable movie. Even the risky ending (when they brought the Corleone brothers back for a flashback scene) worked way better than it should have. But Im never going to watch \n without thinking, \n And thats a problem. Its the Luc Longley/Bill Wennington platoon of that movie. (See? Another NBA analogy. I told you, this is what happens to me.) So for me, the choice was clear.\nBut I get the generational thing, too. If youre under 25, you might feel more attached to \n then a \"classic\" that came out four decades ago, just like you might think LeBron is better than MJ. (I cant stop.) Thats why we worried \n might win ... and it almost did, coming within 66 votes of sneaking into the finals. What a battle. Our friends at Facebook told us that \n vs. \n was the closest voting battle theyve ever had for anything with over 10,000 votes. I thought that was amazing.\nSG: I did.\n\nSG: I have \n as a minus-600 favorite over \n. You know where I stand. And if youre on the fence, just remember ... for all his wisdom, Yoda never came up with a line as great as, \"If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, its that you can kill anyone.\"\n(Well, except for the people who liked \n more than \n.)"}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/36195/nfl-opening-night-the-cowboys-will-ruin-your-rug", "blog_text": "My dog Rufus has three talents and only three. He can dog-paddle into the Pacific Ocean, battle the waves and retrieve tennis balls for hours no matter how far you throw them. He can weasel into any garbage bag with already-eaten barbecue ribs in it -- no matter how tightly you seal the bag, no matter how much time you spent saying, \"We have to make sure that Rufus doesnt get into the garbage\" -- much like Danny Oceans gang can break into any Vegas casino. And after he devours those disgusting barbecue bones, he will crap on at least one rug or kill himself trying. You could give Rufus 500 yards of hardwood floor and two inches of rug and hed figure out how to crap on the rug. Thats just his thing.\nOn Saturday night, we made it too easy for him: Some friends came over, some barbecue was consumed, there was some sloppiness with garbage-can maintenance  you can guess what happened next. Suddenly, it became a staring contest. My wife and I werent letting it happen this time. We made Rufus sleep in our room and removed the rug. We shut the door so he couldnt escape. When our son made an unexpected middle-of-the-night visit and climbed into bed with us, we both woke up and said simultaneously, \"We have to shut the door.\" We made it through the night sleeping with one eye open. No rugs were ruined.\nThe next day, a somber Rufus laid low and only unleashed one poop (on a walk) that wasnt nearly as hellacious as we expected. Hmmmmm. Maybe he didnt eat as many bones as we thought. He slept for much of the day. My wife tried to walk him on Sunday night; he wasnt interested in going that far. He was roping us into his poop vortex, only we didnt realize it yet. We were getting suckered by a golden retriever with a 30 IQ. That night, we fell asleep with Rufus lying on the floor next to our bed -- with our door shut, just to be safe -- only when our son snuck into our bed again, this time, we didnt wake up.\nIt was the only opening that four-legged bastard needed. The next morning, my wife went downstairs first to make coffee. I was still half-asleep and wondering how our snoring son had gotten there. Suddenly, I could hear my wife screaming. Bloodcurdling screams. Screams youd make if you found dead bodies in your house. Screams like the babysitter made in \n.\nOnly this was a different kind of mass murder. See, Rufus had decided to kill not one but two rugs in our house. He pooped everywhere he possibly could. There was real strategy to the pooping, too. His ability to completely avoid the hardwood floor while obliterating two rugs was almost supernatural -- like Aaron Rodgers picking apart a secondary or something. I have never seen so much perfectly placed poop in my life. It was almost like Rufus took a fire hose and meticulously sprayed poop around the room without hitting any walls or floors.\nOne of the rugs wasnt just destroyed; it was practically a biohazard. We didnt know whether to throw it out or call the Centers for Disease Control. The other rug was semi-destroyed but salvageable, as long as we turned it so the post-cleaning poop stains were moved directly under the sofa. (Which is disgusting, when you think about it.) I found myself admiring his discipline, even as I fought the urge to walk him into traffic or throw him tennis balls for three straight days until he sank to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. For nearly 36 hours, he waited and waited and waited and waited, his stomach churning, knowing wed eventually drop our guard and unwittingly enable his poopocalypse.\nWhat does this have to do with tonights Giants-Cowboys game? Theres an exceedingly good chance that Jerry Jones, as an NFL owner, has turned into a post-ribs Rufus. Year after year, he ruins at least one rug as Cowboys fans shrug their shoulders and say the football equivalent of things like, \"Well, were stuck with him, its not like we can just drop him off at the pound and start over, right?\"\nThe Cowboys do everything in the flashiest way possible, obscuring their staggering lack of success in recent years. Starting with the 1997 season, theyve finished exactly .500 (120-120) and won exactly \n playoff game, making all the classic mistakes that a recklessly owned sports franchise makes: using deep pockets to assemble a first-rate front office, then ignoring that front offices input and relying on the whims of their owner; splurging for \"name\" players, despite a seemingly prohibitive salary cap, and saying theyll figure it out later (then being unable to do so); and most important, steadfastly believing they have to win the draft, free agency, the state-of-the-art stadium battle and everything else thats not actually a game or a season.\nWhen a franchise worries about the \n of what its doing instead of what its actually doing, trouble usually ensues. We just watched this happen to the Red Sox. When a franchise underestimates its fans and assumes theyre not smart enough to value things like patience and planning, and that it needs to keep them interested with splashy moves the same way a parent would hand a screaming kid an ice cream cone, trouble usually ensues. Again, we just watched this happen to the Red Sox. Which makes me think the Cowboys will be our next big-market flame-out. Whats been a safer wager than shorting the Cowboys as a Super Bowl contender these past 15 years, or shorting any of those \"Look, everybody, we did something!\" teams in general?\nJust ask Knicks fans and Redskins fans. When your fans fully expect you to crap on the carpet before it even happens, thats officially the point of no return. We reached that point with Jerry a few years ago. Maybe hes a shrewd businessman, but theres a huge difference between making big-picture business decisions and big-picture football decisions. Thats why Dallas keeps having to throw out those rugs. And thats why you cant feel great about Dallass 2012 Super Bowl hopes, much less their chances on national television tonight.\nOn the other side, you have the Giants hosting tonights 2012 opener and flying under the radar as always. Saddled with 2012s toughest schedule and blown off the back pages locally by \"TEBOW VS. SANCHEZ!!!!!!!!!!!!,\" everything has fallen in place perfectly for the defending champs -- few coaches play the \"Nobody Believes In Us!\" card better than Tom Coughlin. Theyll scrap their way through the next four months, lose a couple of stupid games to inferior teams, pull out a couple of ballsy victories on the road, somehow pull out another 10-win season  and like always, everyone will be terrified to see them lurking in the playoffs as one of the best single-elimination teams of this generation. Theyre as predictable as the Cowboys in their own little way. Most football fans dont even know who owns the Giants, just that they have the last name \"Mara,\" and that theyre doing a good job.

Hes terrifying. Hes doing things we havent seen since Kelly Leak was ripping up Little League fields in Southern California. In 134 at-bats since they brought him up on July 23, hes gone .351/.439/.634 with 8 homers, 14 steals and a WAR of WTF. Sometime over the next week, Jennings could pass Carl Crawford in steals, homers and walks while also having a higher slugging percentage than Crawfords OPS ... which, by the way, makes me want to sit on a pitchfork. With apologies to Justin Verlander and Jose \"Im sure as hell not the same at home after that \n sign-stealing story\" Bautista, Jennings has been the best player in either league since Tampa brought him up. With apologies to my man Jacoby Ellsbury, Jennings has been baseballs most exciting player and the most exciting player in any team sport save for Lionel Messi. Actually, screw that midget Messi; Id rather watch Jennings. Hes been so ridiculous that Bill James is going to have to release another \n just to figure out where D.J. ranks against Ruth, Cobb and Hornsby.\nNormally I would be delighted that Tampa screwed up this badly and played the likes of Sam Fuld and Justin Ruggiano ahead of Willie Mays 2.0. But I have Jennings on my League of Dorks team. We were counting him on this season, but by the time Tampa called him up, our season was already in shambles. This makes me angry because, for three solid months my co-owner, Hench, and I couldnt figure out -- for the life of us -- why they wouldnt call Jennings up. So they could delay his free agency for another year? Hes already 24 years old! By the time he hits free agency, hell be in his 30s!!!!! And its not like the 2011 Rays were in rebuilding mode -- they were a borderline playoff team with some genuine A-listers (Shields, Price, Longoria, Zobrist, etc.); Mannys steroid suspension was the perfect opportunity for them to say, \"Screw it, lets give the kid a shot.\" What the hell took them so long?\nHeres where you say, \"They never thought Jennings would be this good.\"\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO! We knew Jennings was going to be good! Keith Law ranked him as the 20th-best prospect in baseball in the preseason ... one spot ahead of Michael Pineda. You know, the guy who made Seattle say in late-March, \"Screw the free agency thing, this guy is ready, were bringing him up.\" At what point can you get TOO cute? I think were here. Congratulations, Tampa, you delayed Desmonds free agency for an extra year ... and ruined your own season and my fantasy season in the process. Im going to mail you the \n of the crap I took this morning.\n\nBill, Im hurt and offended that you think of me that way. Grapes are a commoners food. I only feed Andrew the finest medallions of Wagyu beef, drizzled with truffle oil and seasoned in unicorns blood. Nothing but the best for the greatest general manager in the history of organized sport. Nay, the greatest man who ever lived.\nLets get the obvious stuff out of the way: Jennings is an absolute joy to watch, no doubt about it. Hell, if the only time you ever watched Deezy play was Sunday against the Jays, that would be reason enough to go nuts. On the very first pitch of the game, Brandon Morrow, \n, threw a high fastball, inside edge. Jennings hammered it, a line drive that left the park faster than a Red Sox fan fires off a creative nickname at J.D. Drew. He homered again later in the game, and reached base five out of six times up. Id argue that Curtis Granderson and Troy Tulowitzki have been a little better than Jennings in the past five weeks, but its close.\nIn related news ... its five weeks.\nFrom July 4 to August 11, 1990, Yankees rookie Kevin Maas hit 13 homers in 30 games, and slugged .704.\nFrom July 25 to August 25, 1987, Red Sox rookie Sam Horn hit .346/.418/.741.\nHorns biggest claim to fame is that his name now adorns one of the best fan forums on the web. Maas is now an assistant fry cook at a McDonalds in Hoboken.\n\nThats not fair! You didnt have to bring Sam Horn into this! NOT FAIR! Im still trying to unload his rookie cards on eBay. Only 2,000 more to go.\n\nYou could spend days digging up other examples of rookies who went nuts in their first month in the majors. Did Maas and Horn come with as much prospect hype as Jennings did? Fair to say, no. But prospects are tough to predict. Taking nothing away from Keith Law (who obviously knows his stuff), you cite Jennings no. 20 ranking as if that automatically makes him the next Musial. Here are some of Baseball Americas no. 20 prospects:\nJosh Barfield is currently the assistant to the assistant Hoboken McDonalds fry cook, in case you were wondering.\n\nAnd Gordon Beckham was one of the guys who destroyed my 2011 League of Dorks season. Even worse, we protected him for an extra two years, so going into next season, either we have to keep him at 15 dollars, or waive him and lose $8 at the 2012 auction. People have had easier times getting rid of STDs.\n\nBack to Jennings. He played in 109 games last year at Triple-A. You know how many homers he hit? Three. He dealt with wrist and shoulder injuries all season, and hit just .278/.362/.393. Ninety-eight percent of the time, when a team says theyre keeping a hot prospect in the minors so he can get more seasoning, theyre spouting bullshit. The Rays themselves have been too conservative with several good, young players in the past few years. But if youre going to be a starting corner outfielder on an AL East team that fancies itself a contender, walks and defense and speed arent enough. The Rays needed to see evidence that Jennings could turn on a fastball and do something with it. They didnt have that at the start of the season. Even this year, Jennings \n, including more wrist soreness, and a broken bone in his finger. So when Manny got pinched, they had to decide if a prospect coming off a punchless, injury-plagued season was ready to become an everyday player, while also restarting his service time clock. It was hardly a sure thing.\nStill, I dont totally disagree with you. Sam Fuld went nuts in April (not that the Rays should have expected that), so they were more than covered. Then he stopped hitting, and they didnt have a viable replacement on the major league roster. I still think they should have brought up Brandon Guyer, the other outfielder they got in the Garza deal whos a prospect but not as good as Jennings ... and even then, they got too cute. Both in 2008 and 2010 they had a chance to make a deadline deal for an impact player who might have put them over the top. Yes, they won the AL East both times, and yes, the playoffs are hard to predict. But flags fly forever. In 2010 especially, I felt strongly they should have done whatever it took to get Cliff Lee. They didnt. The Rangers did. Texas was a great team last year. But if Lee went to the Rays instead, it would have been Tampa Bay battling the Yankees for the right to go to the World Series.\nSo yes, once Jennings proved he could hit, Id have liked to have him come up. But they waited because of service time (since Deezy was up last September -- July, not June, was the Super 2 cut-off) and because of the finger injury, and likely cost themselves a couple of games in the standings. Its unfortunate, but it wouldnt have been enough to catch the loaded Red Sox and Yankees this year anyway.\nIm sure Friedmans really sorry about your fantasy team, though.\n\nSorry, Im not buying that \"wouldnt have been enough to catch the loaded Red Sox and Yankees this year anyway\" spin. News flash: The Red Sox and Yankees will still be loaded in 2017 or 2018 or whenever Jennings extra free agency year kicks in ... and then, the season after that, when Jennings signs for $165 million with the Red Sox or Yankees. How many more times will Tampa get the gift of a 2-10 Red Sox start, or the Red Soxs spending one-third of their payroll on the likes of Lackey/Drew/Crawford/Cameron/Jenks? How many more times will Tampa get the gift of the Yankees being stuck in a transition year between \"our guys for the next generation and our guys from the last one,\" or mangling their pitching situation to the point that Ivan Nova might start Game 2 of a playoff series? (And lord, lets hope so.)\n\nOK, first if all, do you know what the Rays record was on the day that Manny bailed? 0-6. You can talk about a 2-10 start or Bostons pissing away money on unproductive players all you want, Bill. The bottom line is that at that time, the Rays had reason to believe that a season projected to be merely pretty good might in fact be mediocre or worse. But lets play optimists and say the Rays wouldnt overreact to six lousy games. Then we have to do the same for Boston. And nearly five months later, the Sox are on pace to win 100 games and fulfill the nearly universal preseason prediction that theyd be the best team in the American League. As for the Yankees, they were seen as having rotation issues, yes. But they were widely picked as the second-best team in the league, and sure enough theyre on pace for 98 wins. Its absolutely the case that only Bartolo Colon and the Dr. Moreau character he visited could have foreseen what hes done. But theyve also gotten disappointing seasons out of A-Rod, Burnett, and others. They had flaws, but they were still an excellent team coming into the season, and they are one now.\n\nAfter Mondays games, Tampa has 60 losses, New York has 52 losses and Boston has 51. Tampa plays Boston and New York \n more times. I dont understand why youre callously dismissing their admittedly slim playoff hopes, or pretending that an entire Jennings season wouldnt have made the race much more interesting. Even Im not dumb enough to think Jennings would be sitting on a 1.13 OPS, 55 steals and 30 homers had they brought him up in April, but even a reasonably good four months that included one hot streak -- lets say .290/.370/.490 with 45 steals and some sterling defense in left field -- would have been worth three or four extra wins, right? Besides, this was ridiculous as it was happening! I mean, Jennings finished with nearly 1,000 Triple-A at-bats, which was great news if Tampas goal was to eventually inspire \n.\n\nEight games in the loss column are \n to make up, let alone in a month. On one hand, 13 games against the Yanks and Sox give the Rays a chance to kick ass in head-to-head play and get themselves right back in it. On the other hand, those are the two best teams in the league, so those are very tough games. (They also have six games left against a very good Texas team.) I absolutely buy the old saying that to be the best you have to beat the best. But this Rays team is not the best. Shortstop is a disaster, B.J. Uptons had a lousy year by his standards, Evan Longorias been BABIPd to death, catchers not pretty, nearly everyone in the bullpen outside of Farnsworth and maybe Peralta have been heinous, etc. Anything can happen in sports, of course. But this was not a great team at any point. I just dont think -- and more important, \n didnt think -- this was their year.\n\nPlease, you act like this was such a disastrous Tampa season. Good luck getting 700 innings, a 3.20 ERA and 600 Ks out of Hellickson, Price and Shields again ... not to mention 27 shocking, decent starts (and counting) from Jeff Niemann and Alex Cobb, or even a ridiculously competent closer year from the one and only Kyle Farnsworth, or everything Matt Joyce and Casey Kotchman did, or Ben Zobrists second sneaky-ridiculous saber season. Im not buying it. Although I like this years excuse for Longoria not living up to the \"Next Big Superstar\" hype again; now he was BABIPd to death? Do we have any suspects yet? Is this going to be a \n episode? And by the way, Im sorry Bud Selig put a gun to Tampas head from April through July and prevented the Rays from trading Upton for additional help to open center field for Jennings.\n\nI think we just fundamentally disagree on the meaning of those 35 games for Jennings. You say \".290/.370/.490 with 45 steals and some sterling defense in left field\" like its a snap. Thats an elite player given where league-wide offense is right now and the pitchers park he plays in. Manny retired on April 8. Based on what Jennings had shown to that point, there was no way in hell anyone could reasonably project anything close to that kind of dominance by Jennings at that point.\nBut this assumes that all baseball decisions are linear, with one neat and clean answer to every question. Maybe thats the way it is if youre a Sox or Yanks fan. But it just isnt that way for the Rays.\n\n(Oh, here we go. Lemme get my violin. Hold on ...)\n\nThe Rays deal in odds and probabilities. Its possible that Jennings could have terrorized the league all season. Its possible that the Rays could have counted on dominant performances from the likes of Farnsworth and Kotchman. Its possible that in addition to all that (weve established that would merely be enough to put the Rays within some kind of striking distance), Reid Brignac and Sean Rodriguez would have hit and John Jaso would have matched his 2010 performance and Longoria would have slayed the luck dragons and Upton would have finally fulfilled the superstar potential we all think he has but probably doesnt exist. Its possible they would have overcome their big offseason splurge being a total bust. Its possible that all of those things would have fallen into place, that they would have won 100 games and banked their third division title in four years. Possible. But not likely.\nSo they played the percentages, waited for Jennings to prove himself in the minors first, and here we are.\n\nOK. But if youre building a relationship with a potential star for the long haul, someone who can hopefully be tricked into signing one of those secretly evil Longoria-like extensions (in which a young player grabs money/security upfront but yields upside on the back end) someday soon, dont you want to do right by that guy? If Im Jennings and Im looking at a FOURTH straight year in Triple-A, and Im looking at the box score and seeing the likes of Ruggiano and Fuld playing ahead of me, heres my mind-set: \"I hate the Tampa Bay Rays.\" That mind-set would affect my day-to-day approach, my spirits, my feelings about remaining in Tampa for as long as possible, you name it. Why risk jeopardizing your relationship with someone who, again, was considered one of the top prospects in baseball? And why risk pissing off your small base of fans who are already pissed off that theyre rooting for a team that spends one-fourth as much money as two other teams in its division? Isnt the goodwill of your understanding the Rays fan base more important than anything?\nWhat happened was a classic example of an extremely smart baseball team making a decision based on a variety of extremely logical assumptions-- the biggest one being, \"If we play this right, we get an extra year of Desmond Jennings!\" -- and ignoring some of the harder-to-measure human elements that accompanied such a decision. Yeah, you get an \"extra year of Desmond Jennings\" ... but that \"extra year\" could have been this season, so its all relative. By the time he brought him up, it was too late. On the bright side, you have an outside chance of getting invited to Deezys 30th birthday party when youre working on \n in 2017.\n(By the way, am I allowed to called Jennings \"Deezy\" or is this privilege only extended to black people and Canadians?)\n\nYoure exaggerating Jennings Triple-A time. Hed played a total of 140 games there coming into this season. Again, I dont disagree that he was ready before they actually called him up. I do think theres value in trying to make your prospects happy. Ive interviewed players before who have told me how pissed they were that theyd been held back for service-time reasons.\nBut this wasnt exactly the biggest miscarriage of justice in human history, either. He hit three homers last year, Bill. Youre basing your argument on after-the-fact assumptions. You say good luck getting 700 killer innings out of Price, Shields and Hellickson, a great season from Farnsworth, etc. But they had no way of knowing, on April 8, that all that would occur. And youve said yourself that Jennings at the very high end might have been worth three or four more wins than other left fielders (on top of his current contributions) if theyd played him all season (which, again, is an \n optimistic scenario, but OK). Even after all those post-hoc analyses and perfect-world scenarios, theyre still four or five back of New York in the loss column with a month to play.\n\nBut Jonah, you keep skipping over the part that there was blood in the water in April! The Red Sox flopped out of the gate. The Yankees were dealing with Phil Hughes dead arm, the Posada/Jeter aging issues and the disturbing fact that they were relying so heavily on Bartolos new and improved stem cells. On the morning of April 16, New York was 7-5, Tampa was 5-8 and Boston was 2-10. On the morning of May 7, New York was 18-12, Tampa was 18-14 and Boston was 14-18. Even on the morning of June 2, right after Sam Fulds historic 28-game stretch from April 28 through May 31 in which he finished .135/.164/.217 over 112 plate appearances, New York was 31-23, Boston was 30-26 and Tampa was 29-26. How does Jennings not get called up at that point? I always thought the point was, you know, to try to win. By the way, were ignoring the bigger issue: Any rule that discourages playoff contenders from promoting exciting rookies in Triple-A needs to be changed as fast as humanly possible.\n\nSo now were at June 2 being the obvious date for Jennings to get called up? He played his first game with the Rays seven weeks after that. In the interim, he hurt his wrist (again) and cracked his finger. But lets say wed have assumed hed stay healthy. Thats seven weeks of extra Jennings. Even in a superoptimistic scenario, youre getting two more wins from him vs. other left fielders over seven weeks.\nAs a fan of good baseball, and of teams showing not only smarts, but balls, Id have loved to see Deezy play all season (my friend R.J. Anderson, who writes for \n and chats with me 87 times a day about the Rays, calls him Deezy -- youre welcome to use it). As someone who over the course of writing a book about this team became a fan, Id love to see a more compelling race. But from an analytical standpoint, this was the right play.\nTheres no reason to lament that great seasons by a few players have been wasted. Deezy will be there on Opening Day next year, Matt Moore (whos arguably a better prospect than Jennings or Hellickson ever was) will join the rotation at some point, theyll upgrade their offense by trading Shields or Niemann or Davis or Cobb, and theyll have a better chance to win next year than they did in 2011. Itd be wonderful to be able to go balls-out every year, doing everything you can to win the division. But baseball isnt set up that way. Least of all for AL East teams outside New York and Boston. You pick your spots, then go for it.\nThis wasnt that year, thats all.\n\nYou must be a blast at the poker tables. Well never agree on this Jennings thing. Alas, theres good news -- because Tampa brought Jennings up after the All Star break, we get to protect him in the League of Dorks through 2015 instead of 2014. I know youre fired up about that, right?\n\nYoure the guy who goes all-in with rags. Im the guy who lets the game come to him.\n \n,"}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6921420/passing-buck", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/all-continuity/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6976758/a-volatile-week-nfl-stock-market", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7007777/the-conclusion-summer-mailbag", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7026680/welcome-amnesty-20-nba", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7033950/a-running-diary-game-162", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7058281/we-need-renegade-basketball-league", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7071243/laying-week-5-odds", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7101566/what-learned-nfl", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7100999/avoiding-lockout-red-sox", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7123705/arms-nhl", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7131896/proactively-mourning-nba", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7160762/nfl-quarterback-power-rankings", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7189740/eddie-murphy", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7181552/bill-jay-youtube-adventure", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7208921/ghosts-manila", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7220622/welcome-national-mailbag-league", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/37493/bill-simmons-recaps-last-nights-homeland", "blog_text": "Andy Greenwald normally recaps \n every Monday in this space, but hes taking a long-overdue vacation this week. I nominated myself to take his place because its my favorite TV show, because it seemed like an editor-in-chief-y thing to do, and also because I was hoping the Brodys would throw another crazy party and wanted to be typing jokes as it happened.\nA quick recap of \n if youve never seen it ... \nBrody spent eight years in Afghanistan as a POW and may have been turned by Al Qaeda ... Brodys family is somewhat terrified of him ... Mrs. Brody was banging his best friend (Mike) right up until Brody miraculously came home, and to be honest, hes probably a better catch than Brody, who has sex with her by either pseudo-raping her or making her sit there topless while he beats off on her ... Brodys pissed-off, pot-smoking 16-year-old daughter is going to start sleeping with her entire high school and possibly the entire NBA soon to get back at her parents ... Claire Danes plays the super-loony CIA agent who convinced herself that Brody turned, spied on him for a few weeks with cameras that were planted inside his house, became attracted to him, got drunk with him and banged him in her car, only its unclear whether she inappropriately went undercover or actually likes him (or maybe both), and by the way, did I mention she is batshit CRAZY? ... Mandy Patinkin plays Saul, the grizzled CIA agent (Claires boss) who kinda sorta failed a lie detector test last week and may have slipped a razor blade to Brodys captured former guard/torturer so the guy would kill himself, or, its a total misunderstanding and hes a really nice guy ... I dont know the name of Claire and Sauls boss, but he might be up to stuff too, and more important, Dennis Haysbert DEFINITELY turned down that part at the last possible second ... and just last week, a terrorist couple renting a suspicious house right near the airport were sniffed out and went on the lam, with the Arab-looking boyfriend eventually getting killed Tony Montana-style by somebody (almost definitely Al Qaeda) and the American-looking girlfriend (she kinda looks like a young Meryl Streep) escaping through a window.\nGot it? Its a fantastic show, you have to believe me. Heres a running diary of Episode 7, which was named \"The Weekend\" but easily could have been called \"Brody Has Normal Sex Again\" or \"Claire Danes Doesnt Care If Its Showtime, She Will NOT Take Her Top Off.\"\n Im not a fan of \ns opening credits. In general, were in a weird era for opening credits -- theyve gotten too ambitious and theres too much going on, as personified by \n (a show with opening credits so excruciating they actually make you stop watching). Whatever happened to the days of \n and \n? Just tell me whos on the show, give me a cool song and dont make me go blind.\n0:02: We see Aileen (the terrorist on the lam) buying a bus ticket in Beaumont, Texas. Shes headed to Mexico. Theres like a 45 percent chance that the Duke and Jack Walsh were at this same bus station 21 years ago. (Obligatory \n joke to win over Alan Sepinwall so he doesnt get threatened that I did a TV recap.)\n Last weeks episode ended with Brody possibly cheating a lie detector test (about feeding a razor blade to that dead guard), then Claire seeing him in the parking lot and inexplicably getting into his car. Why? Because shes crazy. I keep telling you. Even Brody cant figure it out. When she asks where theyre going, he says, \"I dont know, you just got in my car.\" \nThey end up deciding to go to a bar, which is great news for every viewer who enjoys when Claire turns into a drunk/desperate bimbo. But what bar?\nMe, too, Brody. Just promise me well get through the night without you beating off on a crying Claire. Please, promise me. Lets have a pinky swear or something.\n Yes, a billiards scene! Just when I thought I couldnt be more attracted to Crazy Claire, now shes throwing down beers and beating Brody in pool. Reminds me of Tiffani-Amber Thiessen winning over an off-the-wagon Dylan McKay (and also, me) waaaaaaay back in the day. Just a note to the kids out there: Always watch out for a girl who can play pool well when shes drunk. Dont run from them -- if anything, you should run TOWARDS them, just dont fall in love or anything. Watch out. The \"Dont Fall in Love\" hierarchy looks like this \nLEVEL ONE: Porn Star\n\nLEVEL TWO: Stripper\n\nLEVEL THREE: NBA Team Dancer\n\nLEVEL FOUR: Great at Playing Pool While Drunk in a Dive Bar\n\nLEVEL FIVE: \"Last Name Is Kardashian\"\n While Brody was getting beers, a neo-Nazi hit on Claire, then she started a fight with him, then Brody and Claire beat him up and escaped out the back door before the other neo-Nazis got their revenge. See, I told you -- Claire is trouble.\nAnd shes no picnic when shes sober, either. (Brody -- you need to run. Your hole in Afghanistan was safer.) They cant decide where to go next, so Claire says, \"I have a cabin, my family does, Ive been meaning to get there.\" Off to the cabin! \n Cut to Mrs. Brody giving her son and daughter haircuts. This has been the real tragedy of \n -- that Brody couldnt have cut a million-dollar cover-story deal with \n magazine so his kids could afford to pay for their own haircuts. The daughter asks where dad is. Mom says, \"Hes taking the weekend away.\" The daughter says something mean about their marriage, leading to moms defense, \"It was complicated,\" then the daughter saying, \"Yeah, you gave up on him and went whoring out with his best friend.\" You have to love \n, a terrorist show in which a hormonal 16-year-old daughter is meaner than any of the terrorists.\n Saul and Haysbert find out about Aileen the Terrorist heading to Mexico. Programming note: Im calling that character \"Haysbert\" because it pisses me off that Dennis Haysbert isnt playing that character. I love Dennis Haysbert, I miss Dennis Haysbert  other guy, youre no Dennis Haysbert.\n Claire calls her sister because she cant find the familys cabin key. \"You were supposed to come home tonight and get your meds,\" the sis reminds her. Ohhhhhhhhhh boy. Drunk Claire is spending the weekend with Brody and shes off her meds? Im prepared for anything right now. They might have a threesome with a bear.\n Carrie gets into the house (with Brody still outside), finds the familys gun, loads it and hides it. Shes so crazy. I love Claire Danes on this show -- one of my favorite TV characters ever. All bets are off with Claire in every scene. Shes a man-stealing, crazy-eyed, flirty, boozy, pill-popping, inappropriate drunk who also happens to be excellent at her job and our best chance to prevent the next major terrorist incident. Her best role since \n. I also love that shes breaking up someones marriage on Showtime, the same network that runs Mary-Louise Parkers show \n, when once upon a time, Claire stole Billy Crudup from Parker when Parker was seven months pregnant. No, really. \n.\n Carrie jokes with Brody about beating his polygraph. I would have waited until after dinner to bring this up. That leads to this exchange \nHeres the short answer: Yes.\n Aileen the Terrorist gets arrested by Saul and the Mexican police. Now hes driving her back to the States, and if you dont think Mandy Patinkin is going to use these long car scenes to break her down while simultaneously gunning for an Emmy, you obviously dont known Mandy Patinkin well enough.\n Saul to Aileen: \"Im looking forward to the drive. Weve had some upheaval at home. Im looking forward to the peace and quiet.\" Nah, I dont think thats the Emmy clip. We can do better, Mandy.\n Its the next morning and we see Claire staring at the lake and seeming happy. Brody appears. He seems  regretful? Just a little? They talk about how peaceful the lake is. Brody says, \"I should go home.\" Claire nods and doesnt say, \"I should go home, too -- if I dont take my crazy pills, my head will start doing 360s soon.\" But wait, you cant end it now -- this episode was called \"The Weekend.\" This is NOT a weekend. I was promised a weekend!\n Saul tries to break down Aileen while holding an Emmy committee member at gunpoint. Hes doing everything but wearing a \"Patankin for 2012 Emmys\" T-shirt. Finally, she speaks: \"You dont know me,\" she says. This will take time. Mandy seems relieved; he needs more time to win the committee over.\n Brody and Claire havent left yet -- theyre walking in the woods now. Im on edge with every Claire scene. She needs her crazy pills. I mean, she was crazy WITHOUT the pills. Brody does some prying -- what brought Claire to the war veteran support group that night (when they first started flirting)? Claire audibles: \"I lost someone -- my translator,\" and tells a whole story about it. They change topics and talk about Brodys marriage. \n\"Its like she doesnt know exactly who I am now,\" Brody says. Thats not true at all -- youre the guy who shot a deer in her backyard, punched out her buddy, and made her sit there topless while you spanked it. I think she has a pretty good idea who you are, Brody.\n\"Maybe it just takes time,\" Claire says. \n\"I cant be with her,\" Brody says. And I cant blame him. The \"banging my best friend\" thing is a deal-breaker. Theres just no going back. If I disappeared for eight years and Joe House started sleeping with my wife, I would NOT continue to be in his fantasy basketball league. Im on Brodys side here. Plus, he seems happier with Claire -- shes crazy and so is he. Theyre perfect.\n\"This is the first time since Ive been back that Ive found some fucking peace,\" Brody says.\n\"Yeah,\" Claire agrees. \"Me, too, actually. Thats pretty rare for me.\" \n(Important note to the college kids and twentysomethings out there: Anytime a girl admits to you that its rare for her to find peace, just start running. Dont even let her finish the sentence.)\n Even though Brodys daughter has been grounded, that didnt stop her from inviting some friends over to drink beer and smoke pot. Id call her my worst possible scenario for my own daughter in ten years, but that would belittle everything Courtney Stodden has accomplished these past few months. The scene ends with her accidentally walking through a glass door and slicing her arm. Why couldnt this have happened at the next party at the Brodys? Remember, the last two abruptly ended when (a) Brody shot and killed a deer in his backyard, and (b) Brody punched out a crippled war veteran \n his best friend. You know what? Im counting this as a party at the Brodys. There were three guests, thats a party. Our streak is at three!\n Diner scene with Saul and Aileen. Hes still breaking her down, shes still giving him the cold shoulder. (Of course, even by not talking to him, she likes him more than his wife does -- she just fled to India to get away from him.) Saul tries to play the \"Your Dad is worried about you\" card. \"Hes worried about what their friends will think,\" she hisses. \nNow its all making sense -- she was a rich girl living in the Middle East who didnt get enough attention, started \"cavorting with a local brown boy\" (her words), got the wrong kind of attention from Daddy for doing so, and somehow, the whole thing spiraled and now shes renting houses near airports so that Al Qaeda can shoot down planes. The lesson from \n, as always: Things can go REALLY wrong if you have a daughter. I feel sick.\n I feel bad for Brodys wife and Mike (Brodys best friend) -- theyre a cute couple and just want to go back to having good sex and pretending that Mike doesnt want to be the stepdad for Brodys kids when he really does. I should mention that Mike only has a swollen left eye even though Brody punched him hard in the face five or six times. Whatever. \"I just want things to be simple again,\" Mrs. Brody tells Mike. \"I miss you.\" \nShe kisses him before getting called away by one of her kids. Were getting another \"Just in case you forgot, this is Showtime!\" sex scene with her and Mike within two episodes, I can feel it. Uh-oh, the evil daughter is in the room! \n\"Stay away from us,\" she tells Mike. \"Theres no place for my dad when youre here.\" Cant disagree there. By the way, there are definitely some in-the-episode parallels between Aileen the Terrorist Once Upon a Time and Brodys Daughter Now, but I dont want to get too artsy-fartsy on you.\n Brody and Claire stayed at the cabin -- now theyre making dinner and its awkward. So awkward that we have this exchange:\n(Important note: My wife will laugh at any \n joke.)\n Time for a fireplace sex scene. Its intimate and stuff. Claire rubs his torture scars and doesnt seem freaked out by them, which Brody appreciates  not knowing, of course, that she watched him voyeur-style for a solid month. Theres some touching and kissing, followed by some lovemaking and Claires steadfast refusal to get naked on Showtime. Brody stops humping her for a second, causing Claire to say, \"Do you want to stop?\" \n\"No, I just want to live here for a second,\" Brody says.\nAwwwwwwww. \n Brody has a nightmare, wakes up and Claire is right there. Shes making all the right moves thanks to a month of video surveillance. Heres where a sarcastic Patriots hater would make an \"A little like the Patriots back when Belichick taped everyones signals!\" joke. How dare you. \n(That reminds me  HERE COME THE PATRIOTS!)\n Mandy is systematically breaking down Aileen. Were almost there. Shes crying. He just gave her this one: \"I dont know what happened to you, Aileen. I dont know how you went from one more angry teenage girl to joining the jihadists.\" See? Parallels with Brodys daughter! Dont say I didnt warn you when Brodys daughter is praying in the garage with Brody soon.\n Its the next morning again. Claire finally slips up by getting up to make Brody tea and saying, \"No Yorkshire Gold out here in the sticks.\" \nUh-oh. \n\"How do you know the tea I drink?\" Brody asks. Claire does some stammering instead of just saying, \"You drink Yorkshire Gold? I was just arbitrarily throwing a tea brand out! Thats so weird!\" In her defense, it is Day Two of No Crazy Pills. Its amazing she isnt cutting eyes out of magazines and taping them to the wall like Drew Barrymore in \n right now. And yes, I was totally attracted to Drew Barrymore in \n, too.\n Saul calls Shoulda Been Haysbert to say he struck a deal with Aileen -- shes spilling the beans on everything. He says to send someone to the roof of their terrorist house; apparently a potential sniper was up there checking things out. And you know what else? The sniper was the POW that Al Qaeda turned; shes telling a sketch artist what he looks like right now. Will it be Brody? Why does this seem too easy?\n Brody confronts Claire about the Yorkshire Gold thing. Hes pissed. \"Did you spy on me?\" he asks. Dude, you have no idea. Claire stammers some more. We have this exchange:\nClaire thinks about going to get her gun. Brody gives her the old \"You looking for this?\" and shows her the gun. I love that move. Is there a better bad-guy move than \"You looking for this?\" Claire panics and spills the beans, telling him the whole \"One of my best sources told me Abu Nazir flipped a U.S. soldier\" thing.\nBrody yelps, \"Youre telling me the fucking CIA thinks Im working for Al Qaeda?\"\n\"I think youre working for Al Qaeda,\" Claire says defiantly.\nWhoa. This is suddenly a great scene. Brody gets bummed out, sits at the table, hands over the gun and says, \"Ask me anything.\" Claire starts interrogating him. Ill do my best to sum it up. We are finally getting answers, baby!\nFine, I made that last one up. Great great great scene. One of the best of the season. I think Brody just stole Mandy Patinkins Emmy.\n Were back on the roof. Someone on Sauls side is looking around with binoculars. He tells Saul he can see a landing strip for a plane that says, \"Reserve M-1.\" Sauls face goes white. A direct sniper line to \"Reserve Marine-1?\" Thats not good. He asks for Brodys picture so Aileen the Terrorist can look at it. Clearly, Brody was planning to kill the President  right?\n Back to the cabin. Claire tells Brody, \"I know an American POW was turned, it has to be you.\" Youre not going to believe this, but Brody takes offense and decides to leave. Just then, Claires phone starts to ring -- its Saul. He says they were wrong about Brody. Aileen just ID-ed the real POW who turned  its Tom Walker! Hes still alive! This would have been the biggest shocker of the episode if not for Claire having great cell-phone reception at a remote cabin in the middle of nowhere.\nNow, Claire feels terrible and chases down Brody right as hes driving away. She says she was wrong  in other words, \"Im sorry for thinking you were an evil terrorist -- my bad.\" \nBrody isnt buying it. Their weekend ends like this:\nGreat ending. In fact, I would have ended it right there, but they added an extra scene with Brody returning home, checking in on his kids (please, like he cares), opening his bedroom door and seeing his sleeping wife (he cant see, but shes actually wide awake), then closing it and heading into the living room for a good sob on the sofa. Thats right, Brody has been a good guy this WHOLE TIME. Or so were supposed to believe. \nIm still not 100 percent buying it. Are we sure Brody and Walker werent turned together? Are we sure theyre not working in tandem? Why does this Walker scenario seem a little too convenient? And more important, when are the Brodys having another party? I cant wait for the next episode of \n. And with that, were turning this \nrecap franchise back to Andy Greenwald -- thanks for having me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7250994/business-vs-personal", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7273795/the-sports-guy-thanksgiving-picks", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7279015/black-friday-half-mailbag", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7307298/the-first-day-nba-christmas", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7319695/the-second-day-nba-christmas", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7323610/the-third-day-nba-christmas", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7327616/the-fourth-day-nba-christmas", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7334835/the-sixth-day-nba-christmas", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7348176/the-eighth-day-nba-christmas", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7352957/the-ninth-day-nba-christmas", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7357471/the-tenth-day-nba-christmas", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7360397/the-eleventh-day-nba-christmas", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/the-12th-day-nba-christmas/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://grantland.com/features/the-13th-day-nba-christmas/", "blog_text": ""}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/5479/bill-simmons-week-4-quick-picks", "blog_text": "The \"Quick Picks\" for Week 4 \n\nThe Detroit Sports Renaissance continues!!!!! Within a few days, we could have a 4-0 Lions team, a Tigers team in the ALCS, the Red Wings playing again and an NBA lockout partially being solved by the addition of an amnesty clause that would allow Joe Dumars to waive one of his 19 worst contracts. Somebody tell Eminem we need a new \"Here comes Detroit! commercial. Were ready.\n\nSeems like a Trap Game for the Bills  until you remember that Cincy hasnt beaten Buffalo in 23 years, Cincys stadium will be half-full at best (like Miami, they have a home-field disadvantage), its a possible Revenge Game II for Former Harvard Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, and the Bengals are dealing with distractions like \"Benson Will Play Despite Looming Suspension\" and \"Simpson Mum About Pot Probe.\" (Note: I didnt make those headlines up like Fox Sports does; those were real headlines.) Dont you want to live in a world where the Bills and Lions are 4-0? I know I do.\n\nValue pick: Carolinas a little better than you think, Chicagos a little worse than you think (it cant block). I still cant get over \n that got called back last week (or that they didnt save it for a game they could actually win). Wasnt that one of the great random plays in sports history? My three favorite parts: Johnny Knoxs catching the punt over his head like Willie Mays in the 54 World Series, Devin Hesters taking off and nearly catching Knox while running diagonally across the field, and Joe Bucks refusing to crack his voice by even one decibel. This should be a new game show: \"What Would It Take for Joe Buck to Raise His Voice During a Sporting Event?\" When the \n  would he have raised his voice for that? What about the Artest Melee? What if A-Rod and Ryan Howard started making out at first base during the World Series?\n\nLets look at this rationally: The Vikings played San Diego, Tampa and Detroit close and blew all three games. If I wrote a power rankings column this week, I would have ranked Detroit fourth, San Diego eighth, Tampa 11th  and Kansas City 32nd. Minnesota cant win this game by three?\n\nIf you thought defenses were keying on Chris Johnson before, just wait until these next 13 games without Kenny Britt. Could we be headed for the single most disappointing fantasy season since \n? Its in play. In other news, the Madden Curse has been a little weak this year. Threatening to make Peyton Hillis miss a game with strep throat? Thats the best you can do, Madden Curse?\n\nI like this Redskins team in any situation except \"Were down by four, there are two minutes to go   Rex, drive downfield and win the game for us.\" And yes, Im wavering on my \"Rams will start 0-7 and still win the NFC West\" prediction because \n\n  the Niners might be this years Good Bad Team (a.k.a. a forgettable team that beats all the other forgettable teams). That wont help them this week, though. Heres why this line is so high: Vick or no Vick, San Fran averages 3.7 yards per play and gives up 5.0 yards per play; Philly averages 6.0 yards per play and gives up 5.5 yards. San Fran cant throw the ball at all: 505 passing yards total, no wide receiver has more than 80 yards. San Fran is built to play tight games, so if Philly blows it open, literally, theres no way San Fran can come back unless Ted Ginn starts ripping off kick returns. Im laying the nine. Cautiously.\n(Hey, remember two weeks ago, when I wrote that \"you have GOT to try the Theron\" story about having Michael Vick on two fantasy teams? Theres a reason Charlize Theron isnt married.)\n\nNew Orleans is averaging 34.7 points per game. Jacksonville is averaging 9 points a game. So  yeah. In other news, the \"First 2011 Coach Fired\" pool is turning into one of those exciting sausage races like the ones the Brewers have: The kielbasa (Todd Haley) has the early lead, but wait a second, here comes the bratwurst (Jack Del Rio) and the Italian sausage (Tony Sparano)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nFeels like Pittsburgh is headed for one of those \"everyone writes them off, they do just enough to sneak into the playoffs, only as thats happening, theyre getting everyone healthy and quietly righting the ship, and then the playoffs start and everyone realizes that we should be scared of Pittsburgh\" seasons? Trademarked by the 2010 Packers, of course.\n\nI hate this game: You can either go with \"Arizona is sneaky-good at home and the Giants are overvalued\" or \"Always taking the Giants pass rush against a skittish QB who loves throwing off his back foot\" and either train of thought would be right. But lets say the Giants win this one -- their next three games are home against Seattle, Buffalo and Miami. Can you really see \n particular Giants team winning six straight and bringing a 6-1 record into their Week 9 Helmet Catch Redux game in New England? Me neither. By the way, \"Passes Kevin Kolb throws off his back foot\" should be a Vegas prop every week. If this weeks number was 14.5, Id take the over.\n\nMight as well list the stadium instead of the team since its the only good reason to pick the 2011 Seahawks.\n\nThe Packers havent played a kick-ass, start-to-finish game yet. Its coming. Hey, isnt it time for Antonio Gates to pass the Best Fantasy Tight End Torch to Jermichael Finley? Its a little like the WWE title in the old days, right? The title changes hands only every few years, and you can remember every champ: Ben Coates, Shannon Sharpe, Tony Gonzalez, Gates, and now it feels like Finley is next unless we figure out a way to make Aarob Gronkandez happen.\n\nCan San Diego keep bringing Norv Turner back every year until I remember to bet against them for an entire September?\n\nI get it. You want to pick the Raiders. Its a fun pick. You want to think Richard Seymour is going to be fired up, that Darren McFadden is going to run amok, that Jason Campbell is going to complete a couple of bombs, that the fans will carry them the rest of the way. Just remember three things \n The Pats lost last week. Their record after losses in the Belichick/Brady era is something like 950-2.\n The Raiders are coming off a \"We did it!\" game. Never a good sign.\n Oaklands secondary is in shambles post-Nmamdi -- its banged up and wasnt even good to begin with. The Raiders gave up 937 passing yards and six passing TDs to Kyle Orton, Ryan Fitzpatrick and Mark Sanchez. Brady has thrown for 1,327 yards and 11 TDs already. Unless its one of those \"everything went wrong\" games (like what happened in Buffalo last week), the Pats should move up and downfield at will. So if youre picking Oakland, youre saying that (a) the Raiders are going to score 35-plus points, or (a) for the second straight week, the Pats offense is going to have an \"everything went wrong\" game. Believe me, those four points look enticing. I know. I thought about it. And then, I kept thinking about the Pats leading 34-10 in the third quarter and CBS throwing up one of those \"BRADY: 30-32, 345 yards, 4 TDs\" graphics. Hes just done it too many times. This is a stay-away game if anything.\n\nThis feels like the \"After This Game, Youll Start Looking For Reasons Why One Of Us Will Miss The Playoffs\" Bowl. I love getting that extra half-point. Also think the Jets will be fired up for this one. Screw it, lets make it my Pseudo-Upset Special: Jets 23, Ravens 17.\n\nCurtis Painter, on the road, on a Monday night? This feels too good to be true. I feel like Im about to be fleeced in a Ponzi scheme or something.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/7826/the-sports-guys-halloween-costume-rehash", "blog_text": "I enjoy Halloween so much that I once wrote an entire fake \n show about Michael Myers, in 2002. No, really. Its in \n.\nI enjoy Halloween so much that, back in 2007, my wife went into labor with my son on Halloween afternoon  and I was briefly crestfallen when midnight struck and he hadnt popped out yet.\nI enjoy Halloween so much that I joked that same night, \"If this kid is born on Halloween, we have to name him Michael Myers Simmons,\" and my wife didnt think I was kidding.\nI enjoy Halloween so much that I wrote this last year: \"Being a parent of young kids sucks. Dont let anyone tell you differently. About six months ago, I wanted to start a Twitter account of quotes my wife screamed in the heat of those my-kids-are-driving-me-crazy-moments such as these: If you dont stop crying, I am going to stick you in the microwave!!!! and Fine, climb up the stairs again; I hope you fall down, I really do! She wouldnt let me because she thought child services would arrest us. The truth is, every parent snaps from time to time. We cant help it. Our kids job is to suck all forms of life from us, frighten us, embarrass us in public and prevent us from sleeping until they turn four. We pretend its not so bad when, really, its mostly horrible and even somewhat indefensible. But -- and this is a big but -- they parcel out just enough, Wow, Im so glad I had kids moments to make it all worth it. And thats what Halloween is: an entire Wow, Im so glad I had kids day. At least until they eat too much chocolate and wake us up at 5 a.m. the next morning because theyre Exorcist vomiting.\"\nI enjoy Halloween even though I hate getting dressed up for Halloween. In college, I went as Brandon Walsh two years in a row -- I just wore a blue sports jacket, a white t-shirt and fake sideburns. The only time I ever showed any imagination was back in 1998, when \n came out. I bought a black gas-station attendant outfit and wore that along with my Michael Myers mask to the theater. With my future wife in tow. Wait, I shouldnt have admitted this.\nI enjoy Halloween so much that I once wrote this: \"Kids love Halloween because of the candy. Adults love Halloween because its the best party of the year, the best chance to see a co-worker or fellow student dressed like a hooker, the best day to spend with your kids and, if thats not enough, the setting for the best horror movie of all time. And NFL fans love Halloween because it signifies the end of a glorified exhibition season. Come November, the real season begins.\"\nI enjoy Halloween so much that I kept figuring out ways to suggest Halloween costumes for readers in Mailbags and NFL columns over the past few Octobers. We thought it would be fun to look through them again, if only for some of the now-dated sports and pop culture references (except for the Donna Martin reference, which was dated when I wrote it).\nSG: The Sports Gal is going as a mother of a young baby who doesnt sleep enough -- a permanent scowl and eye bags and youre all set. But Im glad you asked because a persons Halloween costume says a lot about them (especially females). Halloween costume choices are distant cousins of playing pool at a bar. In bar pool, there are two types of women -- the ones who bend over because thats the only real way to make a successful shot, or the ones who perform a half-crouch so their butt doesnt stick out  hence, jeopardizing their chances and proving to everyone that they dont really care about winning the game, and theyre only playing so guys will check them out.\n(Just for the record, I dated only two half-crouchers, and neither of them lasted long. Any woman worth her salt will bend over, stick her butt out, try to make the shot and deal with the consequences of random drunken dudes leering at her rear end. This separates the keepers from the pretenders if youre choosing a mate for life -- Im telling you. Dont end up with a half-croucher. These are also the women who wear makeup to bed during the first 6-7 weeks youre dating and pretend they never go to the bathroom until youve been dating for like four years.)\nAnyway, here are the three groups of female Halloween costumes:\n Girls who use their costumes as an excuse to get attention from guys. Common examples include the slutty bunny/cat/genie/nurse/angel/cop/french maid/schoolgirl or slutty anything-with-a-tail. Please note, Im not against any of these costumes -- in fact, I support and applaud them. Mainly because they can be the equivalent of somebody holding up a sign and saying either, \"Im up for some casual sex tonight\" or \"Im definitely ready to start cheating on my boyfriend.\" But heres the problem: Sometimes the girls who make these choices are the quiet/uptight/prudish types who think this is their way of letting loose for the year. So its almost like playing roulette, trying to figure out what their intentions are.\n(By the way, for a less trendy, somewhat slutty costume, you might want to break out the cowgirl or dominatrix gimmicks -- more elaborate, more expensive, but also more respectable, more commendable. You cant go wrong. If you dont have the money, steal it.)\n Girls who go overboard and end up stuck wearing a sweaty mask or costume that legitimately hinders them for the entire night. This is bad -- like Donna Martin dressing as a mermaid for the West Beverly High Halloween party. Could potentially kill your night. Plus, you always get like four monster zits after wearing a sweaty Halloween mask for too long.\n Girls who are downright creative with their costumes. For instance, two years ago at the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" Halloween party, Sarah Silverman dressed up as Sexy Hitler (basically, Hitler in drag as a sexy woman). People at the party were floored. In fact, my editors are floored right now as they decide whether this paragraph can run. But those are the costumes you end up remembering, not the 550,000,000th person who dressed up like a slutty cat.\nWithout further ado, four suggestions for Halloween, 2005:\n\nThis bangs out the \"Im still cute, you might want to think about hooking up with me later\" angle, but its also funny -- you need a blonde wig, a slutty outfit, a liquor bottle, smeared lipstick, fake scrapes on your knees and giant fake knockers. And you just need to stumble around and scream crazy things while your friends hold you up. Later, when you get drunk and start acting like this for real, people will assume that youre still playing the \"Taradise\" role. This also works for Courtney Love if you want to go in that direction.\n\nIf youre going slutty, go all out -- wear a strippers outfit, stick dollar bills in your garter belt and carry around a makeshift strippers pole. Why not go all the way? People will notice you. Especially if youre attending a party that includes Clinton Portis.\n\nDress in a skeleton outfit, only with fancy clothes on. Cant miss and a guaranteed laugh when someone asks who you are.\n\nMy personal favorite. First, go to Marshalls and buy the ugliest beige pants suit you can find. Second, buy a Nancy Reagan wig. Third, buy 8-inch high heels and practice walking awkwardly in them. Fourth, learn how to do that whistle where you stick your index and pinky fingers in your mouth, then make an excruciatingly loud noise. And youre good to go.\nSG: First of all, Im delighted that there will be hundreds of Tara Reids running around on Halloween. This could be the event that causes Carson Daly to finally drop below the 170-pound mark and start looking like Christian Bale in \"The Machinist.\" My four costume ideas for this year:\n\nWear a red wig and look completely strung out for about 30 minutes. Then go to the bathroom, fix your makeup, stick a pair of grapefruits in your bra and come back out looking like a million bucks. Thirty minutes later, go back in the bathroom, mess your makeup up and take the grapefruits out. And just keep rotating the two looks all night and confusing the hell out of every guy there.\n\nYou need a figure skating outfit, ice skates and a male friend willing to act as effeminate as possible for the entire night. Plus, this is one of those secretly slutty columns that will look better as the night goes on.\n\nMy personal favorite. Buy a hideous prom dress and a red wig, then dump a couple of quarts of cranberry juice all over yourself and walk around with a crazy look on your face like youre Ron Artest after the Palace melee. There will be at least one guy at the party who gets turned on by crazy chicks and will want to hook up with you. You cant lose.\n\nJust a perky outfit, a short wig and a microphone for the girl and a Jets jersey and fake nose for the guy and youre ready to go. Not only can the guy playing Namath drink all night without hurting his impersonation, but other guys will step in asking, \"I just want to kiss you, I just want to kiss you.\" Any costume that leads to multiple guys asking to kiss you has to be a winner.\nMe and two friends dressed up like \"Deal or No Deal\" models for a Halloween party last weekend. We bought silver suitcases and wore black dresses and wigs, although we didnt go super-slutty or anything. Girls always used to use Halloween as an excuse to dress like total sluts. Now you dont need an excuse because its OK to dress like a slut in any situation. If you plan on dressing like a cat or a nurse this weekend, or if you plan on wearing a push-up bra with a shirt unbuttoned to your navel, just head to a club after the party and nobody will realize youre wearing a costume.\nAs for Bill, he was supposed to go as Howie Mandel, but his huge head couldnt fit into the bald cap we bought. So he wore a cowboy hat and cowboy shirt and went as a country-western singer. Total cop-out costume! He didnt even care that it didnt look like he cared. The year we started dating, Bill took me to Halloween H20 dressed up like Michael Myers and completely embarrassed me and freaked out everyone else in the theater, but I kind of liked that about him. Now he wont even spend five minutes thinking up a Halloween costume even though he knows I love Halloween. I dont get him sometimes.\nSo we went to the party and half the people put thought into their costumes, while the other half put their costumes together in 90 seconds like Bill did. There were some good ones but nothing really stood out. That got me thinking about my favorite Halloween costume: A few years ago, my friend Allie was a one-night stand. She wore a black cocktail dress that was wrinkled and had some stains on it. She had a ripped stocking, broken heel, smudged lipstick and messed-up hair like she just rolled out of someone elses bed. The whole night she paraded around with things falling out of her purse like she was in the middle of a walk of shame. It sounded like the funniest thing ever. This week I told Bill about Allies costume and made the mistake of asking what his favorite Halloween costume was. He said it was the time his friend Geoff dressed as a poop. I guarantee that my second husband will appreciate Halloween.\nSG: Shannon, youre my hero. I ran this by my unofficial Mailbag Committee (my buddies House, JackO, Wildes, Jacoby, Rydholm and Connor, and yes, I have elections every year to fill those seats because tough mailbag questions deserve that kind of commitment), and we came up with three options for you (that could actually be printed).\n\nJust buy a Plax jersey online, cover your right leg in fake blood, then limp around while holding a fake gun for four hours.\n\nMake a big \"FREE BERNIE MADOFF!\" sign with a matching T-shirt, then walk around screaming \"Free Madoff\" chants until they kick you out.\n\nBut with a twist because you wont go skanky: You dress up like Spitzer (nice suit, bald wig) and get one of your male friends (preferably someone whos overweight and/or hairy) to cram himself into a call girls cocktail dress as Dupree.\n\nBuy a Jeter jersey, cross out the \"J\" and write \"CH\" over it. Then buy a bunch of fake syringes and stick them into various parts of your body. And carry a big fake bottle that says \"STEROIDS\" on it, but fill it with Altoids. Then, walk around all night introducing yourself as \"Derek Cheater.\" This is my favorite idea because not only is it funny but Jeter has such a good reputation, and its so preposterous that hed ever cheat -- really, hes one of the top-three picks in any \"Which Guy From the 90s and 00s Definitely Didnt Cheat\" draft -- that your costume would get a wide range of reactions ranging from \"perplexed\" to \"truly ticked off,\" and people might even yell at you and stuff. Also, youll definitely have your choice of romantic suitors because half the guys there will want to have hate sex with the girl brazen enough to wear a \"Derek Cheater\" costume to a New York Halloween party. Best of luck.\nSG: At the very least, its going to make for a fantastic Halloween costume: Take your LeBron Cavs jersey you dont need anymore, pour some fake blood on the back, tape a knife handle on it and youre good to go. Voila! Instant 2010-11 Cavaliers fan.\nSG: I asked my wife to answer this question. Heres what she wrote:\n\"Wardrobe: Broken-in jeans (frayed at the hem) worn falling down in the rear; wrinkled, vintage Red Sox T-shirt with NOTHING on the back and a coffee or nondescript food stain on the front; zip-navy hooded sweatshirt unzipped; Chuck Taylors; Fred Lynn baseball card in wallet along with at least $300 and 30 extra cards and business cards that you dont need; hair like the late JFK Jr., but with silver highlights; blue/green contacts if you dont have Bills dreamy eyes; he also has giant saucer eyes, so walk around with your eyes wide open like youre in shock.\n\"How to carry yourself: Hold a BlackBerry in your hand at all times with e-mail or Twitter screen open and glance at it a lot; pretend to pay attention to your kids unless they need something, then act distracted like you just got an important e-mail; every 20 minutes, answer your phone and have an annoying basketball or football conversation with someone in a loud voice; if theres a TV in the room showing a game, leave conversations mid-conversation and walk over to it to catch the score even if its totally rude. Finally, Bill has no ass so I dont know how you make that part of the costume. Maybe tape your buttocks so that they are inverted? Good luck.\"\nI will unveil my Halloween costume picks in Fridays NFL column. In the meantime, send Sarah Larimer and the Triangle staff your costume ideas already.\nThe Book of Basketball"}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/10242/the-sports-guys-week-11-picks", "blog_text": "Before we tackle the \"Quick Picks\" for Week 11, we have to mention the latest episode of Americas new favorite show, \n Im on Team Tebow for four reasons \n I love how he drives every NFL expert, every saber nerd and most talking heads and sports columnists insane. They cant handle a world in which Tebow wins ugly and sports defy explanation. It throws their belief system into total flux. The venom/condescension/disbelief pours out of them. Its awesome. I cant get enough of it.\n Along those same lines, how funny is it when announcers try to rationally announce his games, run out of ways to say, \"Another terrible pass by Tebow,\" pretend theres logic involved, then eventually give up and just start laughing when he comes through late? I listened to Tebows fourth-quarter comeback in the car last night -- the radio announcers (Ian Eagle and someone else) literally didnt know what to say. They were just giggling like school kids. How can you explain this? Has there ever been a player who couldnt even be successfully announced? During last nights final drive, Eagle became so excited about Tebows bowling over a Jets defensive back that he actually said the words, \"  just got a mouthful of Tim Tebow!!!!\"\n I have watched something like 1,200 quarterbacks play that position the same way, or relatively the same way. I have never, ever, not ever, seen anyone play quarterback like Tim Tebow plays the position. Its constantly entertaining beyond the scrambling. You never know if hes going to complete even the simplest 5-yard pass to a wide-open guy; by that same token, youre never surprised when he hits someone 40 yards downfield on the fly. Its almost like Tebow is playing with a handicap, like hes overcoming some sort of disability. Hes willing himself to become a decent NFL quarterback despite massive odds against him. I love it. Hes like Rocky Balboa crossed with Strap from \n crossed with some sports movie QB in a film that hasnt been made yet.\n I cant remember another non-superstar athlete generating more feedback from my readers these past few weeks. If it were Tiger, Kobe, Favre or whomever, it would make sense. But the QB of a 5-5 team who completes 45 percent of his passes? Before we get to my Week 11 Quick Picks, heres a sampling just from last night and this morning.\nIf you were God and wanted to get the attention of the American people wouldnt you make your messenger a star QB who wins in improbable ways? Wouldnt you make him a home-schooled, throwback, power-running juggernaut who reminds you of football in the 1920s? MY GOD! Tim Tebow is going to be president in 2028 isnt he? This will keep me awake at night.\n\n \nIs \"Do you like Tim Tebow?\" the \"Tupac or Biggie?\" cultural litmus test of today?\n\n\nTim Tebow is Frank the Tank from \n. Most of the time, hes fun to watch because of all the terrible things he does: overthrow or short-hop a wide open receiver  or scramble around like a chicken with his head cut off. His ineptitude is entertaining, along with the appearance of being overmatched. But once or twice a game he has a \"Frank during the debate\" moment when he blacks out and pulls something spectacularly perfect out of his ass  and that too is entertaining and exciting. If youre a casual fan, youre cheering and enjoying that moment while simultaneously laughing and shaking your head because you cant believe this is the same guy youve been watching all game. In other words, he defies all logic.\n\n\nIsnt Tim Tebow the perfect Irrational Confidence Guy? He is a 35-40% shooter (passer) who somehow plays with the swagger of a superstar. And despite the fact that he is having a terrible game always believes that he should have the ball in his hands when it matters.\n\n\nClearly the Matrix is real, and we currently live in it. It is the only explanation that makes sense with what Tebow is doing. I am in no way suggesting that we should give Tebow the nickname of Neo, because he clearly isnt the one. We should consider calling him Cypher. If you remember, Cypher tried to cut a deal which would allow him to re-enter the matrix as somebody famous. Watching Tebow, I think it makes more sense that the outcome is predetermined in the matrix we live in, then it is that a QB who doesnt know how to throw a ball continues to win.\n\n\nMy office put together a Tebow pool for last nights game -- betting on the o/u for completions (11), yards passing (120), yards rushing (58), passing tds 1.5, and rushing tds 1.5. You can imagine the excitement as he was leading the Broncos down the field making completions and creeping towards the 11 number, then he busts off a 20 yard run, covers the over on the rushing yards, and wins the game. TEBOW!!!! We all decided that this will be a weekly office gambling game.\n\n\nIve seen discussion all over the internet trying to come up with a nickname for Tim Tebow. I dont know if Im late to the game on this one, but I havent seen it used anywhere: Touchdown Jesus. Try to think of a better one. I dont think you can. Notre Dame fans might take issue with it, but they havent really earned the right to keep it the past few years.\n\n\nAfter watching yet another Tim Tebow miracle ending  in terms of stories that would cause the internet to explode, what if Tim Tebow grew a Johnny Damon haircut and beard from a couple years ago and then adamantly refused to acknowledge any questions about it. Wouldnt the question of whether or not Tim Tebow was trying to look like Jesus cause the internet to explode? At a minimum, it would be awesome to watch him politely decline question after question from reporters while they awkwardly tried to ask about it.\n\n\nIm a converted Tebow fan. After seeing him drive down the field and the Broncos MOB him, like he had just won the Super Bowl, I knew he was legit. His teammates play hard for him, and thats worth something. Can we create some sort of \"teammate mob index?\" Last night was a definitely a 10.\n\n\nI know you are down on the Lions but hear me out. Tebow is now 4-1 as a starter in 2011. Who is the one team he lost to? Thats right, the Detroit Lions in a game NFL.com billed as \"Good vs. Evil\". This clearly has the makings of a rematch in the Super Bowl. Its inevitable. Every bad sports movie has the same philosophy. In the first match, the superior \"evil\" team prevailed with ease, consistently mocking the downtrodden hero of the \"good\" team. Later, these teams meet again due to an unpredictable run from the \"good\" team into the championship game that no one saw coming. In the final minutes, the previously downtrodden hero will make a last gasp effort to steal the game from the \"evil\" team resulting in the championship. You know this is happening.\n\n\nOne of my friends keeps hooking up with the ugliest woman in Tucson. She is pitiful to look at and hell even admit to that but swears shes great in bed. We are now calling this girl Tebow. Is this fair since Tebows a virgin?\n\n\nAs Im watching the end of this Jets Vs. Broncos game, I thought of a great nickname for Tim Tebow -- \"Michael Myers.\" Here me out, the entire game the other team thinks theyve slayed the guy. They beat him up. They blitz the shit out of him. They confuse him and dare him to throw the ball AKA fall into their trap. For three quarters of the game he obliges them. He plays like garbage and makes you wonder what the big fuss is about this guy. Then the fourth quarter rolls around and the guy just becomes a killing machine. Just stabbing and slashing the defense with brutal runs before finally stabbing you with one last dagger. The funny thing is that for the first three quarters you love watching the guy fall on his face but then in the 4th quarter he wins you over because he just keeps coming back stronger and stronger. Hes playing like a monster right now. Hide your wife, hide your kids, hide your Jamie Lee Curtis like defense -- Michael Myers is coming for you and he will scream in joy over your teams corpse.\n\n\nAfter watching the Broncos/Jets game, I am convinced that Tebow is like the Madden player that only has known how to run a few good offensive plays. He doesnt want to use those plays too early as the defense will adapt to them, so his goal is to keep the game close, play tough D, play field position, not make any mistakes, and try to keep the game close. When the fourth quarter rolls around, he runs those \"favorite\" plays (QB scramble, option, etc.), the defense isnt ready for them, and then he pulls out a fourth-quarter victory. Simple, yet seems to be effective. Credit Coach Fox for realizing what he has (or doesnt have) and working with it. This of course wont work against a good team (which the Jets arent) that will keep rolling up the points, but in the weak West, Tebow and the Broncos could win it.\n\n\nI think Tim Tebow is a lot like the movie/Broadway show \"The Producers\". Elway and Fox are the producers, Bialystock and Bloom. Tim Tebow is \"Springtime for Hitler\". Elway and Fox think that if they put Tebow out there, hes going to flop and make them look good and theyll be able to draft a new QB. BUT, hes winning even though he still sucks, so Elway and Fox are stuck with this clown until who knows when. Thoughts?\n\n\nYou picked the Jets? Have you forgotten your steadfast gambling rule: \"Never bet against God and puppies\"? While Tebow hasnt promised anyone any puppies, yet, he certainly has God, and hes a winner. Dont bet against God.\n\n\nAnd on that note, here are my Week 11 Quick Picks \n\nTotal momentum play. Tennessee was given a second life in the AFC South with Matt Schaubs injury, and Atlanta has to be still reeling from blowing that New Orleans game. On the bright side, the saber community unanimously agrees -- running Michael Turner straight into 10 Saints and giving away a winnable overtime game for the chance to have a first down from your own 31 was absolutely, unequivocally the right thing to do. Glad thats settled.\n\nCant see Cincy keeping this close without A.J. Green and Leon Hall. But man  it sucks to lay seven with Joe Flacco right now. Theres just no way to feel good about it. I can only imagine how Ravens fans feel.\n(Cut to Ravens fans sadly nodding.)\n\nId take the Jags and Dolphins right now over every other mediocre-or-worse team. Vegas isnt totally believing in their overpowering notsobadness yet. I believe.\n\nI only lay two touchdowns without blinking if the teams QB has a 130 QB rating or higher.\n\nAlex F. from Austin asks, \"Starting with Week 5, you have not written a pick for a Vikings game that was not either one line or combined with the pick for another game. My team is 2-6 and just ended an era of being led by a Wranglers salesman. Theyve been Christian Ponderd out of the Andrew Luck sweepstakes. Their games get the small TV placed awkwardly over the entrance to the restroom at the back of the sports bar. Give me at least a paragraph this week. Even if its entirely about Oakland.\"\nFine, fine. I like your Vikings because this particular spread is a product of the schedule more than anything: The Vikings were beaten three times in four weeks by Green Bay (twice) and Chicago (a trouncing), which makes people think they stink when, really, they just couldnt beat two of the five best teams. And if thats not enough, Carson Palmer on the road! In a dome! As a favorite! Against Jared Allen! Come on, make the leap with me.\n\nIts nearly impossible to play the 2011 Carolina Panthers without dropping 30 on them  unless you have no running backs and your quarterback cant control the ball because hes playing with a broken finger. Then, its sort of possible.\n\n\"Two banged up teams with injury-ravaged offensive lines and secondaries face off in a game that absolutely nobody wants to watch, next on Fox! Hello everyone, Im Chris Myers along with my partner Tim Green  I mean, who else did you expect for this piece-of-crap game?\"\n\nThey cant make this line high enough. Did we ever figure out how the Desperate-For-A-QB Redskins, who had the 16th and 41st picks in last years draft, somehow emerged without a QB in one of the best QB drafts ever? Is Mike Shanahan awake? Are we sure hes awake?\n\nTotally sold on the Bears, totally sold that the Chargers are done, totally expect Devin Hester to return at least one kick in this game (followed by the announcer yelping, \"Why do teams keep kicking off to Devin Hester????\"). Cant we just make Norv Turner the new Jets offensive coordinator right now? Why do we have to wait three more months?\n\nIm almost positive that Ken Whisenhunt wasnt expecting a \"Skelton or Kolb?\" QB controversy.\n\nHow many more ribs would Michael Vick need to break before you finally felt comfortable with Vince Young starting over Vick in a Sunday-night game in Giants Stadium? Im going with nine. Meanwhile, Nick from Baltimore writes, \"Can we now start referring to the Philadelphia Eagles as the Wet Dream Team? They are really fun to watch, until you wake up all embarrassed and have to clean up the mess.\"\n\nI dont know who Tyler Palko is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/11989/the-sports-guys-week-14-picks", "blog_text": "If you want to hear my extended NFL thoughts, check out Mondays \n or Thursdays \n. Here are my super-quick picks for Week 14 \n\nI know, I already lost this one. In my defense, I didnt know Ben Roethlisbergers leg was going to get ripped off his body, then taped back on for the second half.\n\nTotal Uncle Miltie game for the Ravens. In other news, David Stern has vowed to void Indys trade of Peyton Manning to the New York Jets next April.\n\nThe Panthers looked good against Tampa and Indy, making us forget that the Carolina defense gave up 233 points in seven games from Week 4 through Week 12. Remember I told you this as Matt Ryan is hitting wide-open receivers as youre trying to tell Roddy White and Julio Jones apart.\n\nGreat matchup for the Bengals: Maybe theyre down three cornerbacks, but Houston is down one Andre Johnson. I cant believe that my only hesitation here was, \"You know, T.J. Yates isnt that bad  \"\n\nI have this parlayed with \"The Awkwardness of the Blaine Gabbert era\" (-3.5) over the \"Awkwardness of the Raheem Morris era.\"\n\nStill not ruling out a late-season Lions run, followed by things self-combusting in Week 17 at Green Bay when the team commits 350 yards of penalties and Ndamukong Suh gets ejected for driving the teams injury cart into a goalpost, followed by everyone deciding not to blame Jim Schwartz.\n\nGood lord, did anyone see Tyler Palko last week? Has anyone ever pulled off the \"so bad he got benched, then the backup got hurt, then he got thrown back in, then everyone forgot how bad he was because of a Haily Mary and because the other QB was worse\" routine better than him? If the Jets defense gives up more than 10 points in this game, Rex Ryan should be forced to eat barbecue until his lap band breaks.\n\nThank you, America, for continuing not to believe in the Dolphins and Broncos.\n\nSo disappointed that \n didnt have footage of Fred Davis and Trent Williams apologizing to their teammates for their drug suspensions. \nAvatar\n\nChris Johnson killed hundreds of thousands of fantasy seasons, only now hes one of the best starts for Round 1 of the playoffs? That doesnt seem fair. The NFL should make him sit out this weekend or something. By the way, this is my upset special: Titans 27, Saints 16.\n\nIm picking against Green Bay only because of this e-mail from Bob in New Hampshire: \"On Tuesday Packers began offering stock to the public. Stock shares are available for purchase on the Packers web page. The stock certificates are assigned to owners by name. Shares cannot appreciate and they pay no dividend. Shares cant be transferred. There is no exchange or marketplace, and you can only will them to family members. Basically, for $250 you get a piece of paper saying you own part of the team. Shareholders have no ability to buy tickets, no seat licenses, no special benefits, just the certificate that announces you were gullible enough to send the team money for nothing. You do get invited to an annual shareholder meeting, but the shareholders have no decision making ability regarding the future of the team or stadium. Its kind of like a big Facebook account, except Facebook is free. Now get ready for this -- they sold $400,000 worth of stock certificates in the first 11 minutes that they were available! Im not sure if Im more surprised by that fact, or just that the Green Bay Packers figured out this revenue stream before the Red Sox did. At least when you send $250 to the Red Sox they send you a brick.\"\n\nSay it with me: \"I believe in the Cardinals at home. I believe in the Cardinals at home. I believe in the Cardinals at home  \"\n\nSay it with me: \"Im not going to get roped into a late-season Chargers run even after they win this game by 30 points.

Did you know Romo has a chance to end up with 4,500 yards, 35 TDs and 15 or less picks? How did this happen? Was there a 720-yard, nine touchdown game that I missed?\n\nChan Gailey after a six-game losing streak in which his team got outscored by 117 points: \"I dont think we are good right now, but we can be respectable.\" And Tony Sparano got fired?

I mean, did you SEE Joe Webb last weekend? Would you rather give $59 million to Ryan Fitzpatrick or Joe Webb?\n\nIm swinging the other way -- this is such a textbook \"How dare you thought we were going to cruise at home, watch us take a giant crap!\" Giants game that I think the opposite happens.\n\nLike T.J. Yates (sorry, Schaub), love Houstons running game (sorry, Carolinas front-seven), love Houstons pass defense (sorry, Cam), love Houstons Belichickian \"It doesnt matter who gets injured, well keep plowing forward\" mentality (sorry, Belichick). By the way, Gary Kubiak becoming a good NFL coach has to be the upset of the year, and quite possibly, the biggest sports upset since Villanova over Georgetown or the Miracle on Ice.\n\nIts the Acerbically Bitter Fan Base Bowl, presented by Progressive Insurance! Question: How are the Eagles not dead yet? Do you realize theyd win a three-way, 8-8 tiebreaker with the Cowboys and Giants?\n\nIm prepared for anything in this game: 400 yards in penalties, a bench-clearing brawl, either seven turnovers or 450 yards passing and 5 TDs by Carson Palmer with no in-between, Calvin Johnson being forced into defensive duty after every Detroit cornerback gets hurt, Ndamukong Suh deliberately breaking a vase with Al Davis ashes in it, Jim Schwartz sucker-punching Hue Jackson during the postgame handshake \n\nThe strangest line of the week. Denvers outside pass rushers will definitely pressure Brady. New Englands secondary stinks so much that Tebow will be able to light it up even before he starts Hulking up in the fourth quarter. The whole ball control thing worries me; so does the altitude; so does the Patriots willingness to let teams hang around (only now, theyre playing the ultimate hang-around team). And after watching Marion Barber inexplicably run out of bounds AND fumble the game-winning carry, followed by the NFL Networks \n with Tebow in which \n like he knew that crazy Broncos comeback was happening, there might be larger forces at work here. I fully expect the Patriots to win  but I have a feeling Ill be shedding 20 pounds of sweat before its done.\n\nDoesnt the Norv Turner era HAVE to end on a Sunday night, on NBC, in some sort of horrendous way, as Cris Collinsworth says things like, \"Al, I gotta be honest, I dont know what Norv Turner was thinking right there\" and \"What are the Chargers doing????\"\n\nFact: Baltimore already beat Pittsburgh twice this season. Fact: The Ravens and Niners have a similar \"ball control/tough defense/no turnovers/good at home\" gimmick going. Fact: Both Alex Smith and Joe Flacco scare their fans while alternately causing them to become deranged if anyone criticizes them. Fact: I trust Braylon Edwards, Ted Ginn, Michael Crabtree and Vernon Davis about as much as I trust Anquan Boldin, Torrey Smith, Lee Evans and Ed Dickson. Fact: Both Baltimore and San Francisco are coached by someone named \"Harbaugh.\"\n(See where Im going here?)\n New York Times \n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/30258/youtube-hall-of-fame-high-times-with-richard-pryor-final-pyramid-with-dick-clark-and-an-art-lesson", "blog_text": "\n\n When I was growing up in the 1970s, I watched a ton of bad television mainly because there wasnt much else to do. We didnt have the Internet or computers. We barely had video games. We only had 10 or 11 channels. Fortunately, we had game shows. My four favorites were \n, \n, \n, and the great \n, which had the single best ending of any show: a celeb feeding six questions to a contestant for the grand prize (which was never $20,000, but nobody seemed to care). If they didnt get all six right before the clock expired, both sides lost: The contestant didnt win the big prize that wasnt so big, and the celebrity had to suffer the indignity of host Dick Clark sauntering over.\nThe operative word is \"Dick.\" For whatever reason, Dick always jumped on this particular window -- immediately after some poor nobody had lost money, and immediately after some pseudocelebrity who either wasnt famous yet or wasnt famous anymore had just failed to come through -- to make everyone feel even worse than they already did. In the smarmiest way possible, with clinical precision and nary a word wasted, Dick would coldly start lobbing out better clues that would have worked. The implication was always, \"Had you had a real celebrity helping you instead of this moron, you would have won.\" I hated Dick Clark for being such a bully, but also, I \n hating him because any time someone actually won, you wanted to scream at the TV, \"Suck it, Dick! SUCK IT! They didnt need your help, you pompous ass!\" Dick Clark was the game-show host version of the Yankees or Canadiens for me.\nHeres a great example of Dick being a dick: a 1978 Final Pyramid when none other than David Letterman freezes on one of the final clues, then Dick cruises in to chop his balls off, make him look stupid, AND upbraid him for breaking the rules in less than 20 seconds. Its just epic Dick. Im disappointed that Letterman didnt hold a grudge for the next 30 years, then buy Dick Clark Productions and run it into the ground for revenge. The following decade, Dick won me back by starring in \n with Ed McMahon, an entertaining show in which Dick took the lean-over/open-mouth/knee-slap combination, and fake over-laugh, to heights theyve never been before or since. But in the 70s? I hated the guy. And by the way, if you had told 9-year-old me that 41-year-old me would be able to watch old clips of \n on my computer whenever I wanted, 9-year-old me would have been extremely confused.\n\n\n This is Hennessy Youngman. He is, I suppose, an art critic; if you only watch the first 60 seconds of this clip, you will suspect he is a confused, pretentious goofball. But this is not the case -- this is a person who really, really understands what hes talking about, to the point that there is no difference between his jokes and his actual message. Youngman does for art what Nardwuar the Human Serviette did for rock interviewing: He uses an authentic depth of knowledge to explode the fabricated import of what hes supposed to be doing. The above clip is about how to make \"an art,\" although his take on post-structuralism is worth searching for, too (just make sure you find the \n).\n\n\n Tucson, Arizona, 1980, sometime after lunch. Richard Pryor smokes and sweats in the shade, speaking with what seems like authority about the price of whores just down the road in the town of Florence. The interviewer (white, well-meaning) chuckles nervously, asks the cameraman if hes rolling. He is. Pryor is in town filming \n, with Gene Wilder. The interviewer already talked to Pryor once today, but something went wrong with the audio, so Pryors agreed to sit for a do-over, except the problem is sometime between the first interview and this one Pryor seems to have gotten extravagantly high on the finest cocaine available in Tucson. Or \n the cocaine available in Tucson, maybe. He doesnt want to talk about comedy -- when the interviewer tries to kiss his ass by saying hes the greatest comedian since Charlie Chaplin, Pryor says, \"Charlie Chaplins dead, fuck him,\" although he does show a lot of respect for Steve Martin. Mostly he talks about money, and being a criminal from a long line of criminals. He keeps rubbing his nose, mopping sweat off his face and head like hes wearing an uncomfortable mask. And -- metaphors! -- maybe he is; no disguise eats into the face quite like the one you have to wear to play Palatable Black Entertainer when your art is all about transmogrifying pain. \nAnd thats what comes across here: Pryor is in pain. He has been a monster on the set. Showing up late. Demanding helicopters. Walking off set for days at a time over imaginary slights. Backstage its worse. Jennifer Lee, who would marry Pryor in 1981 and then again in 2001, remembered visiting the set: \"He left me in a trailer with the Hells Angels and there were guns everywhere and I was like, what parallel universe am I in? This is not OK.\" In this interview he talks about buying seven pounds of coke in front of eight policemen. In a few months, back home in Northridge, Calif., Pryor, gripped by cocaine psychosis, will douse himself in 151 rum and set himself on fire. This interview, in which Pyror, radioactive with self-loathing, slurs unfunny jokes about the Israeli army and Gene Wilder being a pussy magnet (OK, those are pretty funny) and laughs like a condemned man, is basically a rehearsal for self-immolation. The interviewer is catching him at a bad time, is my point. And yet even though the yayo is visibly working Richs body like a hand puppet made of wet, dead skin, as if hes Malkovich and the drugs are John Cusack, whatever made Pryor Pryor is still there, a pilot light behind his eyes. The interviewer says he thinks well see the day when Richard Pryor writes, directs, and stars in a movie. Pryor -- suddenly so lucid you wonder if hes just been waiting for a question that merits tuning back in -- responds, \"Richard Pryor would never do nothing yall want.\"\n\n\n This fan-made video for Russian musician Valotihkuus song \"Bedroom Pop\" from YouTube user VHSdreamz sums up everything thats great about YouTube as a medium. The excitement of waiting for favorite music videos to come on, of recording things off the TV and watching them a billion times. The degraded fuzzy quality of especially well-loved tapes and the welcoming warm, orangey glow of advertisements and movies you rented from the video store that couldnt be called \"good\" exactly. All the endless intersections between art and trash.  \nPlus, \"Bedroom Pop\" is really great, a lemon-lime soda of a song. The official video is also awesome in a different way. You could make infinite cool music videos for any given song, and the easy accessibility of YouTube means that people actually do. The fan videos for indie acts like Valotihkuu that resemble video art are just as interesting and weird as the 12-year-old girls acting out Taylor Swift songs. The only thing more satisfying than taping things off TV is showing them to your friends.\n\n\n This is the GZA on \n performing \"Knock Knock.\" Chappelle goes nuts at the one-minute mark -- \"I love this  THATS WHY IM IN SHOW BUSINESS!\" Dave made plenty of sidebar exclamations as jokes, but this one feels real. Like the spoon scene in \n, this isnt GZA influencing the zeitgeist through a sketch-comedy show, its hip-hop as a will to power. As \n. As a pill to unplug from \n.

It just wasnt a big deal back then.\" Or: \"Did you know we never owned a car seat? You just sat in my lap as I drove.\" Or, in this case: \"Ah yes, you were repeatedly exposed as an innocent child to footage of Smokey Robinson being groped, grabbed, and molested by a huge doe-eyed foam rendering of the letter U. Thank heavens for publicly funded TV!\"\nFor those of us who were plopped down in the living room and left to the sick mercy of the Childrens Television Workshop during our impressionable youth, YouTube is the closest well come to having Robin Williams stroke the back of our heads and whisper, \"Its not your fault.\" Here, the healing mantra is more along the lines of: \"Its not your imagination.\" A girl taking her pet llama to the dentist? Yeah, \n. A short film that manages to turn milking a cow into an end-of-days-style horror film with a kickin free jazz soundtrack? \n. (Sample comment on that one: \"This scared the crap out of me when I was a little kid. I was sure that the truck was going to crash and the baby was going to starve.\") A young and seemingly stoned Morgan Freeman hepcatting his way around the set? There was \n devoted to \n.\nFor all the what-the-hellery that revisiting these videos can cause, they do make me proud.

Me, Ill take \n any day.\n\n\n Its a weird moment in the life of every basketball bro: A great player retires and you realize that you also watched him play in the McDonalds All-America game. Meaning, you watched every significant moment of his career.   \nHeres the top five \"Oh no, Im getting old\" moments.\n5. HOLY SHIT! That freshman point guard is the same age as my daughter!\n4. Watching a retirement press conference and realizing you watched the players McDonalds High School All-America game.\n3. Watching \n and wondering, \"I wonder why it didnt work out for that guy?\"\n2.

Theyve turned pull-ups into an all-day activity, and they look like it. This is a good clip to watch for motivation, technique, and a look into a subculture that you will most likely never be a part of for a myriad of reasons. Granted, watching it from start to finish is tough, but at least stick around until 2:14 so you get to see \"Honey Bee\" do pull-ups with a baby strapped to her chest.\n\n\n In 1963, Paul McCartney wrote a song called \"A World Without Love\" that John Lennon decided wasnt up to code. So McCartney, wondering if he was capable of a hit outside the Beatles, embarked on a hilarious experiment: He gave the song to his girlfriends nerdy older brother, Peter Asher, \n and half of historys geekiest pop duo, Peter and Gordon. So P&G signed to Capitol and made a bunch of brutally awkward TV appearances, the weirdest of which is posted above (but \n and \n are funny, too). Even though they never figured out which camera to look into, or what to do during the guitar solo, the experiment was a success -- \"World Without Love\" hit no. 1 in the U.S., and neither Peter nor Gordon ever shit their pants on television (or on YouTube, at least)."}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/30965/youtube-hall-of-fame-brawling-bruins-marshmallow-tests-and-the-latest-jamaican-dance-craze", "blog_text": "\n\n\n\n I loved hockey as a kid because of hockey cards, street hockey, the Bruins and hockey fights. And not in that order. The late-1970s Bruins fought so much that my best friend, Reese, and I watched entire games while talking on the phone, just so we could enjoy the fisticuffs live over rehashing them at school the following day. The best three brawlers on those teams were Stan Jonathan (lefty, part-Indian, low center of gravity, the teams best puncher), Terry OReilly (a whirling dervish, also lefty, someone who threw as many haymakers as he took) and John Wensink (completely, totally, utterly insane). Wensink had a tussled afro and a bushy mustache, as well as crazy eyes that always reminded me of my Uncle Rickys Great Dane, Jake. Whenever I played with Jake (we were the same size), Jake would occasionally get a deranged/happy/disassociated look that basically said, \"Im really enjoying this roughhousing, but part of me wants to see what would happen if I chewed off the side of your face.\" I never quite knew how far I could push Jake, and honestly, I didnt want to find out. That was Wensink. He wasnt the greatest fighter, but once he got riled up, all bets were off -- it usually took two referees to pull him away.\nWensinks breakout moment happened on December 1, 1977, during a home game against Minnesota. I am proud to say that I watched this one live. After OReilly and Wensink took turns whipping two overmatched Stars, Wensink skated in front of Minnesotas bench, stopped on a dime, paused for a second, then waved with both hands for another Star to leave the bench and fight him.\nIll repeat that: \nNobody accepted John Wensinks offer. Can you blame them? He waved at the sitting Stars in disgust (exaggerating that wave for the crowd, who reacted like he was throwing them $50 bills), then disdainfully skated to the penalty box much like a professional wrestler would  only he was wearing skates and a hockey uniform. I cant overstate this: At that point of my life (I was eight), this was the single greatest thing I had ever seen. Either I called Reese and we rehashed it for the next 20 minutes, or we were already on the phone yelling in disbelief; I cant remember. There was no DVR, no YouTube, no VHS tapes, just the memory of what we had just witnessed: John Wensink \n and nobody accepting. Screw Clint Eastwood, screw Charles Bronson, screw Starsky and Hutch. As far as we knew, John Wensink was the toughest man alive. And maybe he was.\n\n\n The other night I saw the (excellent) new Errol Morris movie \n, part of which involves some (mostly negative) discussions about Mormonism. As a visual aid, Morris uses footage from this very bizarre cartoon (Ive been told the footage was also used in a Bill Maher documentary, but I never saw that). Now, the way its portrayed in \n -- and even the way it seems when you watch it on YouTube, devoid of context -- one might assume this cartoon was actually made by the Mormon church, possibly as a way to indoctrinate children. But thats not the case. This rotoscoped animation was actually created for a 1982 anti-Mormon movie titled \n. So be aware that this is anti-Mormon propaganda -- although it does seem to work off an educated, literal interpretation of Mormon fundamentalist mythology. No mention of Jimmer Fredette, unfortunately.\n\n\n Jamaican dances are like Apple products: Theres always a newer, faster, and better one just around the corner. Cell-phone cameras and YouTube have accelerated the distribution of the latest reggae dances to the point that something can be popular in the morning and played out that afternoon. Here at Grantland, we wanted to relieve you the stress of having to constantly comb the Internet for the latest dancehall craze, so we provide the above clip. It was published just days ago and at press time had only 18 views, so you know its still good. When trying this dance yourself, its important to note the casual mixing-in of the head smash to your partners derriere. It not all hip, groin, and foot smashes, rookies. By the time youre done learning these moves, another group of teenagers on a rooftop in the Caribbean will have already uploaded a new dance that you cant do. Such is the cycle of life.\n\n\n Two years ago Jonah Lehrer wrote one of my favorite \n pieces, about \n that examined childrens willingness and ability to delay gratification. Overseen by Walter Mischel, the project evolved into a 40-year longitudinal study of its participants and gave rise to some compelling, \n theories of human behavior. More importantly, it yielded a delightful YouTube genre: the Marshmallow Test.\nMischels original Marshmallow Test is brilliant in its simplicity: A child of about 4 is plunked down at a table and presented with a plump, fluffy marshmallow. \"You can eat this marshmallow \n,\" a researcher tells the small, wide-eyed soul. \"But if you wait until I get back in 10 minutes, then Ill give you \n, and then youll have \n!\" The door closes, and were left with nothing but a marshmallow, a kid, and a camera.\nI could watch the resulting footage on an endless loop for weeks. I wish I had a video dossier containing a Marshmallow Test for everyone Ive ever met. Its a miniparade of the human condition: the children squirm, sniff, strain and sigh, and many cant help but succumb. Each kid is a burgeoning Someone You Know -- your stoner uncle, your goody-two-shoes ex-girlfriend, your yo-yo-dieting roommate, your scheming coworker. (It goes the other way, too. I have enough friends who look just like \n to know that the poor lil buddy never had a chance.)\n adds an extra dollop of chocolate sauce and features some of the great Marshmallow-related performances -- the future sociopath at 2:28, the sure valedictorian at 3:20, and the plate-pushing Renee Zellweger lookalike at 4:28. But its the girl \n: First she auditions for Sarah Michelle Gellars role in \n, then she eats \n of the marshmallow in sly hopes of beating the system. \"So, we know shell be successful in life, but well have to watch her,\" says the researcher at the end of the clip. \"So she doesnt go into banking, or work at a cash register.\"\n\n\n Id like to say that my nomination of this clip of Steve Coogan as \n in \"Alan Partridges World Cup Countdown to 94\" was prompted by the recent U.S. release of Michael Winterbottoms culinary travelogue, \n. Or perhaps it was spurred by the recent Womens World Cup and some of the excellent calls made by play-by-play announcer Ian Darke. But really, this clip needs no prompting or spurring for me, as it is pretty much always playing in my mind.\nWhen I leg it up the two flights of stairs to the Smith and 9th St. train in Brooklyn, to catch a soon-to-depart F train I will often hear, \"Yes, yes, yes \" and as I slide through the closing doors, I will often have to restrain myself from saying, \"That  was a goal\" to the man wearing three pairs of pants and having a conversation with a seven-week-old copy of the \n.\nWhenever I find myself pulling into the Cherry Hill Mall in New Jersey on a Saturday afternoon, making illegal left turns and driving like Kurt Russell in \n just to get a space closer to the food court, I will often reward myself with, \"That was liquid football!\"\nAnd regardless of whether its Ian Darke, Martin Tyler, Ray Hudson, or John Champion calling a soccer match, if something \n happens, I always, without fail, say to myself, \"He must have a foot like a traction engine.\"\n\n\n The Sunset Strip used to be cool. It hasnt been remotely cool since the 80s, when Guns N Roses were the kings and everybody else fought it out to be second in a hair-metal \n. The \"teenage riots\" of the 60s are so mythologized that its pretty amazing to see actual footage. Its pretty anticlimactic because it just sounds so much more fun than it actually looks. It looks like a bunch of kids with the same haircut (longish bob, with sideburns on the men) mostly standing around, trying to look cool without getting arrested. Maybe Tyler The Creator from Odd Future can bring it back this summer and recruit his fans to mob all the bloated tourist attractions and boutique hotels on skateboards."}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/31840/youtube-hall-of-fame-tales-from-the-nba-lockout-an-angry-keith-richards-and-shark-week-memories-from-january-jones", "blog_text": "\n\n\n\n Heres a special NBC pregame segment about the NBA lockout.

There was just something missing that kept it from working for me. Thats when I found this YouTube video, which was edited to give homoerotic undertones to an otherwise innocuous scene. And \n, the movie was saved. You may not think the gag that the video creators employ here is one that works for a minute-plus, but youd be surprised how entertaining a noseless wizard hugging an albino teen can be.\n\n\n Confession time: I like this video so much that Ive written about it \n. OK, Ive written about it \n. I know that crime is not a laughing matter. Its very bad! But seriously, this guy is robbing a convenience store with a big stick. Then this other guy defends himself with a hammer! Makes total sense, right?\nI tell myself its OK to gawk at the security footage, because the clerk wasnt seriously hurt (I think  yeah, lets go with that). AND it looks the robber got to keep his big stick. So  you know  not exactly a win-win, but its close enough.\n\n\n There is a unicorn of an MTV game show called \n that was an angstier \n: As you got questions wrong, your favorite stuff would be ruined. Baseball cards through the shredder, surfboards meeting machetes, etc. Or, \n: \"After Round 1, they smashed my \n video tapes with a bowling ball. After Round 2, they ran over my Yoda pillow with a lawnmower. After Round 3, they attacked Derons Birkenstocks with a chainsaw (he wasnt wearing them).\" \nIts as shocking to learn that this destructive show was short-lived as it is to find out that the celibate Shakers had trouble perpetuating their faith. So I was happy to find that reminiscence and \n (which is worth reading just for the story of the contestants Girl Group Dilemma) as proof that the show really existed, as for years Ive brought it up to the blank faces of friends. \nAnd while you can find several examples of \ns contemporary, the \n, on YouTube (Like \n, or \n), the only clear evidence of \n is this clip, which omits all the actual trashing but does feature \n, a band that right around that same time was terrifying carpool-driving mothers nationwide with the mainstream hit \"3 Little Pigs.\" Pretty fitting representation for the best weird game show that no one seems to remember.\n\n\n In lieu of a sizzle reel for the new season of \n, please accept this Shark Week-related clip of January Jones talking about swimming with sharks.\n \n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this story through Facebook, \n."}, {"url": "http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/32300/youtube-hall-of-fame-george-michael-a-knife-throwing-mom-and-a-space-armadillo", "blog_text": "\n\n Im ashamed to admit that I watched some of VH1 Classics 30th anniversary celebration of MTV two weekends ago. OK, I watched most of it. Fine, fine, I DVRed all 12 hours and ripped through those 12 shows like a fat kid plowing through Halloween candy. MTV Classic not existing might be our single biggest television failure -- you cant even believe how many iconic musical and pop culture moments that channel produced until theyre randomly flying at you in a totally haphazard manner.\n Agreed. There needs to be a station where I can watch Soul Asylums \n \n the \n between Missy, Lil Kim, Da Brat, Left Eye and Angie Martinez, and \n all in a row. Also, I need to be able to judge my adolescent crush on Kennedy in hindsight.\n You can judge your entire puberty in hindsight. Did you know Madonnas performance of \"Like a Virgin\" at the 1985 VMAs caused me to sprout my first chest hair? Seeing that again -- and the possibility of seeing other things like that again -- was what had me so hooked. At one point, in the span of 35 minutes, I saw Radiohead perform \"Creep\" at MTVs Beach House (check out \n), Chris Rock crushing his \n (I loved the part when he starts making fun of J.Los ass), three \n (the last great Cobain moment), and the highlight of Tom Greens career (a hidden-camera gag when he painted two females having oral sex on the trunk of his dads car, then tried to give his dad a ride to work). I remembered most of these moments. I definitely did \n remember George Michaels performance from MTVs 10th Anniversary performance in 1991. \n I guess there was some truth to the whole \"MTV generation\" tag. Something about the styling and the slightly rebellious tone of MTV during the 90 really made it stick in the collective adolescent memory. Actually, if I ever start a cult, Im going to base it on old music videos. Its going to be like Scientology, but for even stupider people. Instead of going back through your past to unlock forgotten traumas, Im going to just preach therapy through pop music nostalgia. Instead of asking something like, \"So, what happened back then that is hurting you now?\" I would ask, \"What was your happiest memory of Mr. Bigs To Be With You?\" Or, \"When you first heard Nelsons After the Rain, what were you doing?\" Then Id play 20 nostalgia videos on a big projector and charge insane prices on concessions and merchandise. \n I like this idea -- if we can have a sports psychologist, then we can definitely have a music psychologist. George Michaels music doesnt really trigger anything from my past except two things: The \"I Want Your Sex\" video had a bunch of supermodels, and whenever \"Freedom\" came on during a party when I was in college, girls would scream happily and start dancing with each other in their heavy sweaters. (Its the same reason I didnt mind Erasure in college.) Two fond memories, right, Mr. Music Psychologist? \n Thats why the cult will work! Girls in small colleges in New England are the most depressed species of living thing on Gods green earth. If \"Freedom\" can make \n happy enough to stop what theyre usually doing (frowning into keg cups and talking shit about Cindys black pants) and dance, you can start a cult with it. Id call my cult, \"Like a Prayer,\" and Id start every sermon with, \"Life is a Mystery  Everyone must stand alone. I hear you call MY NAME!\"\n Were getting away from George, hes getting pissed. This \"Freedom\" performance was his greatest moment ever; these five minutes trumped anything the other George Michael ever did on \"The Sports Machine.\" The first few seconds threw me off; I just assumed we were headed for an awkward live performance shot out of a time warp. Poor George looked like he was going through a phase -- like he was trying to distance himself from the Wham! era and maybe even hiding his sexuality a little. That led to him wearing a backwards Raiders hat and a leather jacket. I dont think it was a good idea for George Michael to dress like Ice Cube really ever, but especially in 1991. So its really hard to take him seriously as the song kicks in. And then the song kicks in.\n The Raiders hat is definitely the best detail of that video. Heres another question I would ask my followers: \"Why did MTV blur out the Raiders hats in rap videos, but didnt blur them out in the George Michael 10th Anniversary performance?\" My next question? \"Do you think George Michael wore that hat in 1991 because he was the only white guy on stage with about 20 black backup singers?\"\n George was definitely overcompensating. Theres no question.\n A cranky side note: I dont think this performance could happen in 2011. George Michael wouldve been outed long before he came out, the Raiders hat wouldve been nixed, and they wouldve thrown at least 1 1/2  other races out on stage. Some a-hole producer would have made him medley the song with \"Faith,\" and during the transition, Elton John and his piano would be rolled on stage.\n Congratulations, you just came up with a special \n theme show for next season. By the way, I judge all contrived live performances by how they would have killed on \n. Had Adam Lambert done this exact same performance two years ago -- sans the Raiders hat, obviously -- not only would it have brought the house down, Simon Cowell would have self-combusted. There just would have been Simon shrapnel everywhere.\n Im mostly impressed with how happy and confident George Michael seems on stage right here. Like hes having the time of his life, isnt he?\n Agreed. I dont know what to make of this performance. Its brilliant. I finished it thinking, \"Was George Michael totally underrated? Was this guy one of the best performers of his generation and I had no idea? Or was this a random event that didnt mean anything -- like if Jason Terry scored 52 points in a Finals game, and we left the game saying, Wow, Terry was red-hot, what a game! and thats all it meant?\" Youre the guy who broke down the greatest divas of all time, youre the guy who just created a music psychology cult  you tell me what to think.\n He scores pretty highly on the \n because he had snappy hand motions, weight fluctuations, drug problems, rehab dramas, a legitimately great singing voice, and commercial success. This MTV moment wouldve scored something like a 160 out of 200 in the Iconic Performance metric, which is pretty strong. (Whitneys Super Bowl \n was a 200/200, whereas Jordin Sparks \n winning moment as a 3/200). He even does well in the \"Aging into a Drag Queen/Wearing F#@$-ed Up Hats\" metric, where hes just a smidge below Celine Dion.\nHurting George Michael was the fact that he never really took the listener on an emotional journey. Thats the biggest demerit you can accrue, really. Without that emotional tie, you wont be memorable enough to attain true diva status. (WELCOME TO YOUR FORGOTTEN LIFE, BEYONCE circa 2025!!! #teamkellyclarkson)\nIts too bad they dont have HGH for singers because George Michael has the perfect setup for one big comeback song, a la Chers \n. I guess Auto-Tune kind of is HGH for singers, but given that his deficit is an emotional one, its hard to imagine that some catchy T-Painish club hit would really change George Michaels status. \nIf were closing the book on him right now, Id say he rates a little below TLC. Both had long careers, a few classics, crazy behavior, and the charisma to make you smile 15 years after the fact. Being just below TLC is a pretty damn good career, by the way. \n\n\n If you were ever worried about screwing up your kids by giving them milk with hormones in it, just click on the above clip for a taste of Louella Gallagers parenting methods and youll immediately feel better about yourself.

It is the last time this term will come into meaningful play for the next four minutes and 31 seconds.\n Do you think these guys all called each other to match their jean color before the gig?

I got this one. Seriously.\"\n My friend Gabe McKinley: \"Coldplay has hit rock bottom.\"\n Just a spectacular sequence, as the camera pans between the bassist and the guitarist, both of whom are mouthing the lyrics and very obviously still royally pissed about the fight that they had in the van on the way over about who should be the lead singer.\n Crucial moment. The disgusted-at-self headshake. Its starting to sink in: This isnt going well. Its not going to get better. We may be totally, irrecoverably boned.\n Oh no.\n Oh god, no.\n Look at the veins standing out on that guys neck! The effort! The self-disgust!\n CLASSIC eyebrow raise from the bassist. The total, \"I guess we just power through, but dude \" moment.\n BLUE FLAME MOTORCYCLE SHIRT! BLUE FLAME MOTORCYCLE SHIRT!\n Patronizing applause. Roach-like scurrying off the stage. A single, sad \"Yay.\" \n And  fin.\n\n\n The Mystery of the Flying Space Armadillo.\n\n\n A long time ago, back before publicists or decorum were invented, nobody gave better interviews than Bob Dylan. Would he show up (allegedly!) \n? Let \n Completely ignore questions and \n? You never knew! Heres a relatively lucid TV interview from 1984, conducted shortly before Dylan split for lifeguard duty. \n\n\n I was originally going to link to this video, taken in late 1997, of \n ad campaign in front of some sort of branding or marketing audience, because Ive always loved the \"Think Different\" commercial with an embarrassing passion. (\n: It was quicker and easier than usual for them to obtain the rights to lots of the images because Joan Baez was Steve Jobs ex-girlfriend and Yoko Ono was his former neighbor.) Watching Jobs talk about Apple and comparable like Nike in 1997 is like watching clips of Shaquille ONeal on the Orlando Magic -- hes basically already at the top of his game, and yet you know hes going to go so much higher.\nIf I sound like a fangirl, I am: My relationship with Apple goes back to my youth, as most dorky connections with teams or bands (or technology corporations, as it were) tend to do. In other words: I totally went to MacWorld Boston in 1997, man. I was 14, so I didnt spring for the fancy tickets that got you into Steve Jobs keynote speech. But heres the video of what happened that day in that room.\nIts hard to explain how big this was and is. Like, thank god Twitter wasnt a thing. Bailed out by the enemy, Microsoft! Apple Computer was at that point not long for this world. Management was a disaster, a conveyer belt of visionless CEOs. Market share languished, especially once Windows 95 snatched all the Apple-y things from Apple and took off. (That they were even willing to help Apple was largely to shield themselves from a monopoly situation.) The Newton was -- hahahah, \n. Apples share price went to somewhere around 12 at one point. \n on its \n: \"The Fall of an American Icon.\" \nThe reaction from the crowd here at MacWorld is beautiful to watch.  I think my favorite guy is the one who shouts \"Noooo!\" several times around 2:46. Theyre angry, but they get that theyre otherwise doomed. They cant believe Steve Jobs would do this to them -- and at the start I kinda think they think its maybe even a prank -- but they hold fast to their love: Note how desperately they laugh at his bad jokes throughout. And as much as they jeer Microsoft and Internet Explorer when the words come up on screen, they cant quite be so impolite to a videoconferenced-in Bill Gates, who smiles like hes some sort of paternalistic commissioner, the (shudder) lovechild of David Stern and Bud Selig.\n, which preceded by a few months that trippy plastic blue iMac that your parents probably still have in the guestroom, is widely considered one of Apples great turning points. But it was a month or so earlier at MacWorld that everything began to take shape. And I just love that the rebirth of one of the worlds biggest companies was initially premised around so basic a storyline -- Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.\n\n\n This is a video of a goat singing along to Ushers \"\n.\" Do I really need to keep typing? OK, FINE. Is Goat Usher better than Person Usher? Maybe, right? Goat Usher is certainly a rare talent. Which part of this video do you get tired of first: The \"bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\" or the actual song? I think the song, but then again, I really like goats. Sorry, Usher. Whatever the case, \"Goat sing with Usher\" is definitely an upgrade from what I guess is the 1.0 version of this video (hat tip: Grantland intern Sam Schube): \n.

Tons and tons of cocaine. (Fine, Im guessing. You come up with a better explanation.) I beg you to waste 10 minutes watching this clip.

Tomlin didnt officially come out of the closet until 2001, although you could make a pretty strong case that she did during this movie (directed by her real-life partner, Jane Wagner, by the way). Travoltas career survived, at least for a few years, although it really should have ended after the hot tub scene at 4:45. Only the \n movie poster came out a winner: Its tagline was \"The only thing they have in common  is each other.\" Thats a great point. Literally, it was the only thing they had in common: the fact that the other person also happened to be in the room. Try to find me a stiffer on-screen couple.

We all lived with the \"Hitler Reacts\" meme for far too long. Meet its replacement.\n\n2. I had forgot all about \n, the 1979 movie this clip is from, which was Paul Schraders big \n follow-up. I went back and tried to watch it again this morning. Newish parents? You might want to steer clear of this one.\n\n3. Holy balls does \n look TERRIBLE.\n\n\n This is a delightful montage of a 3-year-old Peyton Manning playing football. Watch it to see the genesis of the Manning Face. YOU CANT GWAB BY THE NECK! (For comparisons sake: \n. Who knew he was ever so mobile?)\n\n\n Honestly, I feel sorry for this reporter. So, so sorry. Is he trying to make this storm look worse than it actually is, as the title of this video implies? Or are these guys just showing off back there to ruin some dudes live shot? Tough question. But heres a little journalism secret: Covering a hurricane sucks. Seriously. Its the pits. You have to deal nonstop weather warnings, demanding coverage plans, and things that are actually known as \n. And thats before the actual storm arrives. Then you have to leave your home, go stand in the rain, and to top it all off -- there are usually one or two jokers like this who walk in the back of your live shot. Rough.\nI often think of this clip during hurricane season, when my buddies back in South Florida are stocking up on Pop Tarts and  OK, mostly just Pop Tarts. Well. That clip, and \n. Ugh. The worst.\n\n\n Kristen Wiigs \n on Bjorks twee eccentricity is an underrated tool in the comediennes arsenal -- but even at its best its never touched the real thing. This is Bjork, upon cracking open a TV -- to figure out how it transports her to so many \"weird situations\"  -- and seeing the intricate wiring: \"This looks like a ceeety  like a little model of a ceeety. All the houses, which are heres, and streets. This is maybe an elevator to go up, up theres.\" Nobody dare tell Bjork thats not a goddamn elevator.\n\n\n With \n and Kate Winslet saving elderly people out of burning buildings this week, I figured it might be time to remember this awesome animated short film about the time Werner Herzog rescued Joaquin Phoenix from an overturned car.

Full disclosure: I have never seen this movie. A friend of mine noticed the \n poster in my office and asked if I had ever seen \n. When I said no, he started laughing and said, \"You gotta see it, its crazy, Cathy Lee Crosby coaches a high school basketball team and starts banging one of the players.\" What??? Forget about the deficit and the jobs crisis; when a movie can be accurately described as \"\n meets \n meets a Skinemax movie\" and ISNT showing on cable at least once a month, now thats when weve failed as a country. Please watch the embedded trailer if you dont believe me.\nSix additional notes: (1) As far as I can tell, this movie easily could have been turned into a porn without doing anything other than extending the sex scenes; (2) at one point in the early-1980s, Cathy Lee Crosby was dating star Redskins QB Joe Theismann and starring on the ABC ratings smash \n, so theres a decent chance she called in a few favors and systematically destroyed all copies of this movie; (3) its good to see what the lead guy from \n was doing before he was assigned to protect John Connor; (4) the Stallions are shockingly good at hoops for a bad seventies sports movie (Id have them as 1-point favorites over Hickory High); (5) the trailer makes history by showing the ending of the movie in the trailer (again, theres a decent chance this was originally a porn and they decided last minute to edit out the hardcore sex and release it commercially); and (6) will we ever have an adequate explanation for what happened in the late 1970s that doesnt include the words, \"Dude, I dont know what to tell you, everyone was just doing a ton of cocaine\"?\n\n\n Two words: Basketball Jesus.\n\n\n When I was a young tow-headed fellow, we used to play a game called \"Billy Sims\" where the singular goal was to jump over a bed (against a defender) while holding a Nerf football. I loved it. I wish I could play again, because now I know who ELO is, too.\n\n\n In anticipation of this weeks showdown between Penn State and Alabama, here is a video of Bear Bryant, dressed up like Fred Rogers, making some sort of point about maximizing ones ability by inscribing random numbers on a chalkboard. After which I imagine he completed the lesson by doing precisely what Mr. Rogers would have done: He mounted a tower and made everyone in that room run wind sprints until they vomited.\n\n\n The surface reason for including this live video of the Forgetters is pretty self-evident. This song will reduce you to a pile of smoldering ashes. Formed in Brooklyn, the band released \"The Night Accelerates\" as a single in 2010. Fronted by Blake Schwarzenbach, formerly the singer/guitarist behind Jets To Brazil and the seminal punk rock  Jawbreaker, the Forgetters may have never attained the notoriety of Schwarzenbachs previous outfits, but \"Night Accelerates\" is up there with the best songs hes ever written or recorded. \"I ought to charge you by the hour, for all the time I think of you. I caught you plotting my demise, I thought I ought to help you try.\" Whats up. Thats your yearbook quote.\nThe other reason I love this video is its setting. This was recorded in 09 at a place called Nowe Miasto in New Orleans. Nowe Miasto \"is a collectively run multi-racial, social justice-centered limited equity housing cooperative and multi-use autonomous community space, promoting art, music, community activism, and housing affordability.\" Of course it is. Shows at places like this can be a drag because theres nowhere to go to the bathroom and theres usually a dog and nobody knows who it belongs to and the smell can be ... provocative.\nI like watching this clip because it reminds of some of the shows I would see in peoples basements in Boston in the mid-nineties. The one, unshaded lightbulb as light-source; the random pieces of plywood and drywall sitting around; the hose hanging on the wall; people drinking beer and sitting in makeshift seating; the kid doing the absolutely perfect Hamlet-holding-the-skull dance in the front of the crowd. Schwarzenbach silhouetted; bass player Caroline Paquita singing along to the lyrics in the beginning; the little twirl the drummer gives his sticks before the beat starts. Theres probably a dog somewhere. I wish I was there.\n\n\n DJ culture is fucking out of control.\n\n\n My buddy Metcalfe can always be counted on for weird conversations and stuff like that. A few days ago, we were part of an e-mail exchange about whether the police had jurisdiction over swirlies (Probably not, right?). And dont even bother asking us about \n, because were practically experts. So I am surprised that he sent me this bizarre video of a machine that eats a box of tampons? No, I am not.\nHere are some other things the machine can eat, according to this clip:\nYou get the idea. The best part: It looks like you can \n. Id totally want to get one, too, if they threw in a free CD of the music from this video.

Quiet on the set \"\n\n\n A few weeks ago, I was talking to a handful people about the Timothy Olyphant/Steve Zahn film \n, a movie thats much, much more fun to watch than logic would dictate. This conversation evolved into a debate over twist-oriented movies and how satisfying it is to experience even a bad example of this genre, assuming the twist is well designed and authentically surprising. The next day, someone sent me a link to this clip: Its the first nine minutes of a short film titled \n (the remaining two chunks are available nearby). This was originally aired on the Sundance Channel, so you first need to sit through a short, rambling explanation from Roger Ebert as to why this particular film was being broadcast on TV. But when you get to the actual low-budget production, its pretty decent; it wont obliterate your mind, but its better than what you likely anticipate a 15-minute YouTube movie should be. And you cant beat the price.\n\n\n Its mid-September, which means its time to start doing wall sits and \n in preparation for ski season. Its also time to start breaking out the ski porn -- no, Im not talking about \n, you sickos, but rather the Teton Gravity Research-type films that combine killer soundtracks with unbelievable footage of extreme big-mountain skiing. Pro tip: Do a DVR search for Warren Miller and record a few; they make excellent ambient programming during parties, at bedtime, or while youre washing the dishes and wishing you werent.\nIf you want to go retro, though, and you definitely do, you cant get any better than \n. (Another reason its called ski porn is that the puns are equally bad.) Greg Stumps 1988 movie has \n of an \n, but its real, and sponsored by Swatch. \n helped introduce the world to Glen Plake, the mohawked and hotdogging self-described \"bad boy\" of skiing, but more important, it brought us Rasta Stevie, the dreadlocked Telluride councilman representing the \"Pro-Conscious Development Party.\" Its unclear what Rasta Stevie is up to these days -- some say theyve spotted him in Costa Rica -- but given this footage I think I speak for a nation when I say that I hope he resurfaces in the upcoming primaries. Shred on. Is it winter yet?\n You may know Carlos Jacott as the hang-dog fellow who offed Mormon entrepreneur Bill Henrickson on \n, or, alternately, as that dude from that thing you watched one time when you may or may not have been high. His IMDb resume is utterly spectacular, a \n-like tour through the past 15 years of popular culture: He played Ramon the Pool Guy on \n and Larry the Agent in \n; he had bit roles on \n and \n and \n and \n and \n and \n and \n and \n. And yet to me he will always be Otis, the pajama-top wearing, remote-thieving goof from Noah Baumbachs \n, the finest movie ever made about post-college life, book clubs, sleeping with freshmen, broken glass, and men who would rather be bow-hunting.\nBetween the years of 1995 and 2000, I probably viewed \n in its entirety 200 times. I have committed the entire film to memory; in other words, I probably have a more intimate relationship with these 10 minutes of footage than I do with most of my close friends. Most notable is the scene that begins at the 4:45 mark \n (embedding disabled), known to archivists and curators as \"The Cookie Man Sequence.\" Several years ago, at a Legal Sea Foods in Harvard Square, a young lady noticed Carlos Jacott sitting at the bar with a group of friends, and, unprompted, sashayed over to him, whispered in his ear, \"Go away cookie man,\" then walked away.

Sadly, Hulu has embargoed all the \n sketches (like the \"Mr. Belvedere Fan Club,\" one of the \n), but some of the \n appearances live on. Our first clip is an early Hanks appearance from 1984 when he made \n. (Important note: I loved Hanks from \n and \n, and I loved Lettermans show, obviously, so I specifically remember rooting for Hanks to crush this 1984 appearance so hed become a regular a la Jay Leno, Eddie Murphy, George Miller, Marv Albert, Richard Lewis and the others who passed through. I dont remember if it was Hanks first \n appearance, but he couldnt have been on more than once or twice.) Our \n, after hed achieved \"regular guest\" status and came on to discuss his recent European trip to promote \n. You can see the difference between 1984 Hanks (funny, slightly uncomfortable, doesnt totally have chemistry with Letterman yet) to 1988 Hanks (full command, knows exactly how to hit Lettermans funny bone).\n\n\n \"Sunrise doesnt last all morning,\" the mustachioed man explained. \"A cloud burst doesnt last all day.\" These statements are both true. Theyre also examples of how George Harrison managed to slip into the best possible class of celebrity: Like Bob Dylan, Lil Wayne, and Thich Nhat Hahn, Harrison was able to seem super-profound by simply stating banal truisms about life. Obviously, this doesnt work for everyone (can you imagine how much people would ridicule Darius Rucker if he built a song around the sentiment \"I dig love\"?). Yet -- for certain special individuals -- saying whats obviously true makes the rest of us recognize the depth of everything we already know. Youll notice this effortless quality throughout Martin Scorseses upcoming two-part Harrison documentary on HBO (\n), the best film ever made about the third-most famous member of a rock band. My wife got a preview copy and Ive already watched the whole thing twice. In the meantime, heres a clip of the Beatles doing a demo version of \"All Things Must Pass,\" a song they mysteriously elected to leave off \n.\n\n\n Ever have a panic attack? They are terrifying, paralyzing experiences. Theyre the worst and there is no cure for them -- until now. Meet Val Silver. Shes discovered a cure that includes running to the bathroom, focusing on your feet, and holding a pose that is most often seen while doing a dance known as \"The Sprinkler.\" Immediately after they stopped recording, the parrot in the background blurted, \"Or you could just pop a Xanax.\"\n\n\n Sometimes the end of summer feels like trying to push a pile of pandas up a slide. You can try all you want to impose order, but youll still end up covered in fuzzy chaos.\n\n\n This is seven straight minutes of Mos Def -- who, just to make things absolutely clear, is himself an obsessively beloved MC -- in the studio rolling a blunt while utterly, gushingly geeking out over DOOM, the enigmatic masked rapper behind multiple underground rap classics. For the most part, its Mos rattling off whole chunks of verse off the top of his head (\"Rappers is stripping males / out of work jerks since they shut down Chippendales\"), then breaking out into awed hysterics. But really priceless are the asides: \"When I saw that Madvillain record, I bought it on  vinyl ... I aint have a record player. I bought it on vinyl just to stare at the album. I stared at it and I just kept going I understand you.\" The purity of his fandom is inspirational.\n\n\n Do they still make after-school specials? The answer doesnt really matter, because none (with the possible exception of \n, which I actually watched in real time) has been quite as memorable as \n or, as you may colloquially know it, \"the one where Helen Hunt on PCP hurls herself out the window.\" (Note to would-be eBayers wordwide: The made-for-TV movie called \n is actually a \n Helen Hunt say-no-to-drugs vehicle.) There are so many great things about \n, one being that it has its own catchphrase -- \"no biggie\" -- and another being everyones hair. Also, since when does pot make you get all extra-sassy toward teachers? Id more so expect those bathroom-toking girls to scatter like roaches in a fit of extreme paranoia, or so Ive been told by a friend. (\n.)\n\n\n This week Id hoped to write about crazed personal-injury lawyer Jim \"The Hammer\" Shapiro, \n in my hometown of Rochester, New York, for loud TV commercials in which he apologizes for not being able to \"rip out the hearts of those that hurt you\" or \"hand you their severed heads.\" Unfortunately, none of those ads are embeddable (though you can watch them \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n). But luckily, a YouTube search turned up plenty of TV spots for other \n \n personal-injury attorneys, my favorite of which is Lowell \"The Hammer\" Stanley, whose expert use of stock footage here should make him your first call if youre ever injured by a Transformer.\n\n\n For a couple of years there, the best part of the BET Awards was watching these promo videos of Cyphers. DJ drops a recognizable break and rappers get about a minute in the spotlight, filmed in black and white. Do it simple, do it right.\n\nIm not sure if they still produce these, but this clip, from the 2009 show, is as good a reason as any to stop; nobody is gonna top this. With Gang Starrs DJ Premier on the cut, Mos Def (who absolutely blacks out), Black Thought, and Eminem get a little \n. Its always fun to watch Shady just rap, especially over non-Dre beats (for a change), but I really love this clip because it reminds me that Mos can basically be as bad (meaning good) as anyone, when he feels like it. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this story through Facebook, \n.

It needs to come from an iconic movie, or at the very least, an iconic movie \n. It needs to take some of the characters from that movie to another level, OR, it needs to cement why I liked those characters in the first place. And it needs to make me think, \"I cant believe they left that scene out of the movie, its inexplicable.\"\nThe truth is, deleted scenes are almost always deleted for a reason. But there are those rare times when you cant figure out the reason. \n My two favorites are the \n and the \n. In a vacuum, \"Stairway to Heaven\" is a better scene: William wants to explain to his mother why rock music means so much to him, so he plays her \"Stairway to Heaven\" with two unidentified women and his sisters ex-boyfriend sitting in the room as the \"jury.\" The ex-boyfriend steals the scene. And then some. Hes hilarious. The scene makes you appreciate that song, and Led Zeppelin, and the movie in general. Crowe couldnt get the rights and couldnt include it in the movie... which wasnt a bad thing. I think it would have derailed the movies momentum; its just too long. In fact, you could argue that its the perfect deleted scene: it increases your enjoyment for the movie without detracting from the movie in any way. Its practically a 9-minute short film - you can enjoy it without seeing the actual movie. Im glad Crowe couldnt get the rights.\nBut cutting that \n scene? I dont get it. In less than three minutes, every character gets captured by their reactions to Dirk winning \"Best Actor\" for the second straight year. (My favorite: the Colonel happily clapping with his jailbait girlfriend sitting next to him.) Heres a rare case where the deleted scene adds to your enjoyment of the movie AND would have improved the movie. Director Paul Thomas Anderson admitted in the directors commentary that he chopped it because of the movies swollen length, but you can tell he loved the scene. He should have kept it. I dont know if its the greatest deleted scene ever, but it captures why I love that movie. Lets see what everyone else thinks.\n\n\n Like the shark itself, the character of Quint in Steven Spielbergs 1975 film \n functions as a catalyst, whose primary purpose is to elicit reactions and cause disruption. Hes the apex of the dysfunctional family triangle, with the other two points being Martin Brody and Matt Hooper acting as siblings trying to win the affection and attention of their unfeeling father. As a result, Quint is always seen \n or \n his metaphoric kin. So what makes this deleted scene so unique is that it features the salty Captain of the Orca acting on his own. It shows Quint at (probably) his most bi-polar and diabolical as he pleasantly enters a music supply shop to purchase some piano wire (which he uses as line for larger-than-normal fish) but quickly shifts his demeanor and proceeds to torment a young child struggling to play Ludwig Vans 9th Symphony on his clarinet. Its as if Quint takes the childs performance personally. Hes pleased when its properly delivered, infuriated when bungled, and then just loses his mind and starts to shout out the notes at the poor child who turns his eyes upwards to almost say, \"Yep, this is happening again. Just let the crazy man get it out of his system.\" The action in this scene is so specific its almost impossible to figure out where in the film it would have fit -- it feels almost like its been lifted from a Quint centric spin-off film -- so its understandable why it was cut. \n\n\n This is Bill Hader and Seth Rogen doing the kind of improvising that happens on the sets of most Judd Apatow movies. Its not a standalone scene that should have made the final cut: its a string of stop-and-start riffing, and some of the lines here are actually are in the movie, surrounded here by all the other wonderfully ridiculous stuff coming out of these peoples mouths (\"in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma you go right to mouthskies. Day one.\") Not all of these jokes hit, but its nice to see two people in a movie trying really hard to make each other laugh. After a remarkably long, hit-and-miss stretch in which Rogen and Hader admittedly exhaust all conversation in regards to how be great itd be if crime scenes really were covered with semen like on \n (\"This is a proven historical fact: Sherlock Holmes, when he was alive, knew where semen was\"), director Greg Mottola chimes in off-camera with a deadpan \"Do a semen run,\" and the dudes really lose it. Its pretty endearing.\n\n\n Im sure I should probably have picked a piece of lost footage from \n or something, but I dont even think Orson Welles would begrudge this lost \n clip its place in the Cooperstown of deleted scenes. I could seriously watch Rob Riggle, Adam Scott and Will Ferrell sit in a room for a week. Also love that Ferrell somehow becomes the straight man in this scene. There are tons of extras, bonuses and cutting room floor gems from Adam McKay flicks, but this scene is easily my favorite. Youre having a heart attack!\n\n\n Comedic set pieces tend to get bigger and louder (think of the parade scene at the end of \n) as the movie progresses and while \n has a lot of hilarious larger moments, some of the biggest laughs came from small ones: tiny gestures, mutterings, and dance moves. This deleted scene from the recently released DVD (which boasts over 2 hours of cut scenes and outtakes) expands the argument between Annie (Kristin Wiig) and a 13 year old girl (Mia Rose Frampton, daughter of Peter \"Show Me The Way\" Frampton) at the jewelry store Annie works into a veritable master class on conversational improvising. Things that specifically kill me: the angry polite whispering, Wiigs disgusted gasps, the way her shoulders tilt as she literally sinks down to the girls level, the Swiffer/broom/mop argument, and \"I had a spicy ... steak ... sub.\"\n\n\n This \"deleted scene\" is from \n. No other film captures the essence of being young, black, and reckless in the early to mid-1990s so viscerally. An absolutely ruthless piece of cinema, the first part of this clip pretty much contains everything that will make watching with your mother or grandmother uncomfortable. But theres a whole generation of O-dogs who know all these lines and scenes by heart. \nThis is sort of a \"meta\" deleted scene. Theres a running joke about the video at the very beginning of the clip -- a VHS tape recording of the shooting that propels the plot of the movie -- being a deleted scene. An episode no one is ever supposed to see. Mostly, though, I imagine the rec room at Grantland HQ in L.A. plays out like this after every week of the Bad Quarterback Fantasy League. Someones gonna try and put a hole in Cam Newton, I know it.  \n\n\n For some unfathomable reason, Rob Reiner trimmed \n from its original four-hour length down to a measly 82 minutes, leaving enough outtakes to choke a drummer. There are plenty of classic deleted scenes that should arguably have made the final cut, including \n (\"think of the baboons as the counterculture\"), an \n (\"if it sounds familiar, its not\"), and, best of all, this clip starring the late Bruno Kirby as Taps limo driver whose first marijuana experience leaves him half-naked and singing Sinatras \"All the Way\" into a pizza crust.\n\n\n At some point in the mid-aughts, around the time he berated a panda bear on a faux-San Diego newscast, it became physically impossible to hate Paul Rudd. Even people whose job it is to be reflexively contrarian have referred to Rudd as \"funny\" and \"underrated.\" You may quibble with his choice of roles, but to hate on Rudd himself would be like raging against chocolate syrup, or a litter of Labrador puppies, or Steve Nash: All these things exist only to make us feel a little bit brighter about our otherwise futile lives.\nOf course, if you are reading this website, you probably dont need to me tell you about any of the scenes Rudd has stolen in countless Apatovian bro-comedies. That said, Rudd has also appeared in some terrible movies in recent months; since late 2009, he has shown up in a regrettable Harold Ramis project, a failed Jay Roach adaptation of a French comedy, and a critically reviled James L. Brooks film. Which makes me wonder whether his comedic career peaked with 2009s \n, a movie that -- like all of the masterworks of the Apatow mafias oeuvre -- is silly and ridiculous and hinges on vomit and masturbation jokes. And yet it also features Rudds finest performance in a decade, as a hopelessly prattling goofball who has no clue how to make friends with other men. You could watch the whole movie, if you havent already; but at the very least, you should watch these outtakes, which encapsulate Rudds awkward on-screen charm in a way that nothing has before or since. Every single line in here is a fraternity-house catchphrase waiting to happen, and I mean that in the kindest possible way. Forget the overcooked \"Slappin Da Bass\" trope: That \"I will hit you on the chips\" and \"I will catch you on the beans\" havent been co-opted as marketing slogans proves that Madison Avenue has lost its way.\nSomeday, when it becomes fashionable to condemn Paul Rudd as annoying and past his prime, we can always return to these 103 seconds as a reminder of why we found him so unimpeachable in the first place. If nothing else, he gifted us with the best Golden Richards reference since Super Bowl XII.\n\n\n Throughout most of \n, the title characters presence is felt mainly via his absence: you never see his face in the first film, and while hes around a lot more in the second its mostly domestic in nature, all sandwiches and pet goldfish. Hes almost more chilling that way: when he \n with that big butcher knife, you dont need to wonder what else he could do with it; based on the skills of his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad minions, you basically know.\nStill, its great fun to watch this fully formed deleted scene, which is included on the \n DVD, to see just what ole Bill is indeed capable of: namely, dispatching a revenge-seeking samurai played by real-life martial artist Michael Jai White in a scene that is creative, delightfully overdone and, with its sound effects and quickly-zooming cameras, clearly a Shaw Brothers homage. White camps it up (with a shoddy New Zealand accent, to boot) in the style of one of those old dubbed-over films: his response to Bills faux-innocent \"Can I help you?\" is a hilarious \"HAHAHAHAH you bastard. The only thing you can do for me ... IS DIE.\" \nWe may not have seen the last of that particular cheesy samurai: \n that although the fight, which was part of \"a much longer sequence,\" was ultimately omitted, Quentin Tarantino \"still wants me to do something with the character.\" The scene would have certainly worked in the movie, establishing in full sight Bills badassery (and his distinctly Pai Mei-esque hand-fighting technique) as well as Beatrix Kiddos wide-eyed desire to learn how to do that herself. Without it, though, were instead left to use our imaginations right up until the movies final fight, and theres nothing scarier than the unknown.\n \n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this story through Facebook, \n.

Nobody remembers this now, just like nobody remembers Joe Piscopo. They were in dozens and dozens of sketches together, peaking with their hilarious bit about Sinatra and Stevie Wonder joining forces for \n \n For two solid seasons, nobody else on the cast mattered. They may have well been extras. Even if Eddie was a bigger star, Piscopo was probably featured in more sketches: He could impersonate any celebrity and always ended up being the lead of any game show/talk show host sketch. They used him the way Dan Aykroyd was used, and how Will Ferrell and Phil Hartman would eventually be used.\nEddie left the show midway through the 1983-84 season, but not before a marathon night at 30 Rock in which they banked a bunch of Eddie bits to sprinkle through the remaining shows. The last sketch featured Eddie and Joe playing semi-homeless old guys at a piano bar -- two of their favorite characters -- and playfully wrestling off-camera at the finish. At the time, I just assumed that they had at least five buddy-cop movies in their future. But the truth was, Eddie was too big for a sidekick. He didnt need one. A few months after he left \n, \n made him the biggest star in the world. By 1986, Eddie could do whatever he wanted and Piscopos career was going south. So when Eddie agreed to appear in Piscopos comeback comedy special in 1986 (\n), it was a pretty big deal because \n Eddie did was a big deal in 1986. I remember watching the show specifically because of Eddie. They filmed a piece called \"New Jersey Vice,\" a \n parody, with Piscopo as Crockett and Murphy as Tubbs (skip to two-minute mark). It could have been funnier, but still, it was pretty funny. And the toll booth scene slays me. Its also Joe Piscopos last legitimately funny moment. Twenty-five years later, nobody even remembers that he helped saved \n. But he did.\n\n\n \n isnt a good movie. Its riddled with lazy rom-com cliches, slowed by a wooden leading lady and saddled with the most \n of Africa outside of a Joseph Conrad novel. It is, however, a great movie, full of incredible one-liners, \n, and hairstyles that will definitely \n. Its also an exhilarating glimpse at Eddie Murphy at his absolute creative peak, the moment when he was trying anything and everything was working: It was Michael Jordans 1992, Ted Williams 1941, and Ryan Goslings 2011 rolled into one hilarious, latex-dependent whole. Although its hard to top his turn as the guy we all know as Joe the Policeman on the \"Whats Goin Down\" episode of \n, his greatest triumph in the film, to my mind, is also the least recognizable. As Saul, the old Jewish guy who inexplicably hangs out in the black barbershop, Eddie is completely covered but totally present. This bit, taken from the end credits, works because while it may concern itself with schmaltz, its never shtick: Hes as remarkable kibitzing as he is fronting Sexual Chocolate. He may be telling jokes, but this is a seriously impressive performance, sly and clever when it could easily have been broad and boorish. Taste the soup!\n\n\n You know those horrible/glorious bars that play the music videos while the songs are blasting? Well, a few years ago there was a three-month stretch where \"Party All the Time\" would play within five minutes of my entrance into a particular bar. It was like a party trick that I had no control over. \"Party All the Time\" is, hands down, my favorite Eddie Murphy career move, but surprisingly it has NOTHING to do with Eddie Murphy. They should have retitled the video \"Rick James Will Party All the Time With You, Whether Eddie Is Around or Not.\" Calling Rick James performance a \"cameo\" is like referring to Brandy as \"Ray-Js sister.\" Rude Rude Rude. Rick is the star of this production and theres nothing Eddie Murphy can do about it. Every time hes on-camera, with that supersize curly fry mop shag of a hairdo, I think to myself, \"This might very well be the greatest man alive.\" Watch this for Rick and only Rick. Especially 2:47-2:51. (Youll probably cry.) Once with sound, and then muted on loop in the top right-hand corner of your monitor for the rest of the day.\n\n\n My parents CD collection goes about 35 units deep and consists mostly of Israeli seventies folk-rock (what up, Arik Einstein?), so we dont usually agree on too much pop culture. But theyve always loved the crap out of \n, for all the obvious reasons, and inculcated us at an early age, with repeated viewings, to fully appreciate its genius. That means watching Eddie Murphy pretend he just realized he has legs -- \"I can walk! Jesus, praise Jesus! Look at me, this is too much! First Moses, now this!\" -- is, personally, extra-comforting. Bonus fact! The guys who wrote this also wrote \n.\n\n\n I probably should have submitted this last week for the \n category, but somehow I suspected that one day wed be doing either an all-Eddie Murphy or Michael Jackson YouTube Hall of Fame and this would be my automatic entrant. Make sure you watch the last two seconds in particular, and then hit \"replay,\" like Ive been doing all morning.\n\n\n For my money, the defining role of Murphys career is in the 1999 Hollywood satire \n. Directed by Frank Oz, and written by and co-starring Steve Martin, Eddie once again plays multiple roles, but here eschews prosthetics and heavy makeup in favor of two distinct physical performances, as Kit Ramsey and his lovable neer-do-well brother Jiff. The setup is simple: Since he cant secure the biggest star in Hollywood (Murphys Kit) for his next film, a destitute film producer (Steve Martin) opts to secretly shoot the movie around the star, using his look-alike brother (Murphys Jiff) to fill in the gaps. With Kit, Murphy didnt need to do much; he was essentially playing a hyperbolic version of a public persona pegged on him in the late 90s (reclusive, emotionally unstable, and paranoid). But with Jiff, the purest of Murphys real talents shined. Even though Jiff looks almost exactly the same as Kit -- with a slight slough, a facial scrunch, a subtle wig, a pair of glasses, and a set of orthodontics -- Eddie was able to create a second fully formed character. I challenge anyone to watch the film and not think Kit and Jiff are played by different actors. Oz and Martin never shot a scene in which Kit and Jiff appeared together, so Ive chosen one of the stronger Jiff scenes. Watch how Murphy embraces Jiffs nebbishes and fully commits and delivers on his eccentricities (him screaming \"Heavenly Father\" over and over still kills me). Both \n and I think it was a crime Murphy wasnt nominated for an Oscar.\n\n\n Eddie Murphy has given plenty of great performances in double roles (see above), and one of them was in this awesome 1983 \"Weekend Update\" sketch, from back when \n could occasionally be confused with \n. In it, he plays both Buckwheat (RIP) and Buckwheats assassin, John David Stutts, who is also assassinated. Lets see that tape again!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this story through Facebook, \n.

Even worse, Im pretty sure it convinced me to convince my parents to buy me the game. Like everyone else, I played it for about two weeks before either breaking it or shoving it in a closet and hoping it would break. Can you imagine a creepy memory game being marketed today, in the era of cable TV, iPads, video games, \n and the Internet? I dont think my kids would play Simon for more than 90 seconds. And if they played it for more than 90 seconds, Id become concerned. Either way, I want to report with complete confidence that nobody played Simon in my era in front of (a) a throng of cheering kids, and (b) a doting, jacket-holding blonde who seemed ready to put out in the woods right after the game. You played it alone. And eventually stopped, before you lost the will to live.\n\n\n Perhaps no toy in history has humbled us more than the Etch A Sketch. Its the ultimate leveler, a simple device that promises the effortless joy of creative expression and delivers only the bitter tang of failure. Almost since its invention in France 51 years ago, every American child has dutifully received his or her own little red tablet, and not a single one of them -- outside of \n and this poor \n, who has already suffered enough -- ever managed to produce anything more than unspeakable frustration and a quickly erased squiggle.\nSo perhaps it wasnt totally preposterous that I -- along with thousands of other easily swayed 9-year-olds -- was completely suckered by the introduction of the Etch A Sketch Animator just in time for the holiday season of 1986. Clearly the problem didnt lie with my own creativity and draftsmanship -- it was the technology! Just look how much fun that budding blond Tex Avery was having in the comfort of the \n board he called home! Ten minutes alone with this thing and I figured Id be the coolest kid at school, a pixel-powered satirist with his fingers fully on the pulse of the later Reagan years. Id be twisting those knobs like a pro in no time! (In retrospect, the biggest lie this commercial told was the idea that a preteen who spends his time alone in his room making low-resolution cartoons is \"going places.\" What places are those? Definitely not ones with girls in them.)\nSo, yes, I actually received an Etch A Sketch Animator that year thanks to the extreme generosity of my parents (it retailed for something insane like $50) and my tactical lack of siblings. It took me about an hour to realize it was even more pointless than an actual Etch A Sketch. The hard part: to animate something you first had to draw it. The harder part: After saving your initial drawing, you then had to draw it again -- only this time with a slight difference in order to create movement. Oh, I created movement all right: by throwing the goddamn thing across the living room. Childrens toys are supposed to inspire, not depress. Etch A Sketches of all kinds are dream-crushers of the first order, cruel and vicious machines that have taught countless generations of young people that greatness is impossible and cruel fate -- in the form of an errant shake or a dying AA battery -- can undo the best laid plans in a heartbeat.\nCome to think of it, no wonder these things are popular in Cleveland.\n\n\n Could anything seem cooler to a 10-year-old? You get lowered into a post-apocalyptic underworld fighting ring on your hovering, purple triangle or star, and then commence spraying oversized BBs all over the place. Did I mention you also get to wear a leather jacket and have your hair gelled back? And that after you vanquish your opponent you get to pump your fist and yell, \"Yeah! Yeah!\" Say no more. Im sold.\n Four notes on the greatest game neither you nor I ever owned, Crossfire:\n1. My belief is that there was a Crossfire set on every street in America, but no two neighboring homes had the game. Why was this? Not sure, but I think the game was priced at $4,000. I couldnt have less data to prove this, but I think Im right. \n2. Whoever is slapping the bass in this Crossfire commercial cant possibly have fingers anymore. Ive never heard anything more intense.\n3. I think Crossfire was my introduction to rock and roll. And you thought being raised on Zeppelin was awesome.\n4. I would bet my life savings that when this commercial states, \"Its sometime in the future \", they were thinking about 2012. I think this might be what post-rapture America looks like. Just listen to the lyrics: \"Crossfire, youll get caught up in the Crossfire. Crossfire. CROSSFIRE.\" Wow. Have we planned for this yet? Someone forward this video to Herman Cain immediately. \n\n\n The marketing fantasy: happy kids bouncing safely around an awesome castle. The miserable reality: bloody, fractured victims lying dead in their driveways. The Pogo Bal was a pretty crappy toy, but as a means of population control it beats everything but condoms and lawn darts. Like a pogo stick without the balancing apparatus, these things were responsible for the deaths of at least 200 of my first-grade classmates. The only reason I lived to see 1990 was because my parents bought me a Nintendo instead. Thanks, Mom and Dad.\n\n\n I wanted a Teddy Ruxpin SO BADLY as a kid that I very vividly remember having a dream one night about it. (The fact that I remember a dream I had as a 5-year-old makes me terrified to ever have kids.) Anyway, my mean parents never let me have one, and Im guessing its because they had seen the creepy, glazed-over faces of the children in this commercial.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this story through Facebook, \n.

If not for YouTube, I would have just assumed that I imagined the whole thing. But thats the great thing about YouTube -- you can use it to confirm hazy memories, and almost always, they dont match up to what you remembered. In this case, the actual commercial was about 24 percent stranger than I remembered. A few months earlier, Kareem broke his hand punching Kent Benson in the face -- apparently this commercial was part of his suspension. Now Im wondering if my dislike for Kareem (he was my least favorite player even when I was little) drove me away from Atari and toward Intellivision. I mean, \n caused me to become an Intellivision kid, right? I have it narrowed down to either Kareem or Carol Channing.\n\n\nOne of the biggest bummers about graduating from college is it becomes so much tougher to immediately pinpoint important dates and times -- i.e., you can no longer insta-recall, say, a cheeseburger commercial: \"Oh, this aired in 2002 because I remember it was my freshman spring and I was dating a guy who was on crutches following a freak lacrosse injury which hed always play up in order to get his friends to drive us to Burger King for the Shaq Pack which we were \n craving because we were \n seeing the commercial (and parroting the falsetto \"SHAQ!\") because we were \n lying around on the sloppy sofas in his dirty off-campus house debating whether it was true that nutmeg could get you high and watching the L.A. Lakers power through the playoffs with Kobe and Shaq, and also, that guy is now engaged.\" Anyway, you can have your McRib or your Starbucks pumpkin latte, because theres only room for one novelty fast-food item (\n) in the clogged arteries of my heart: the SHAQ PACK. Can you dig it? And yo, can we get a ride?\n\n\nIs this the greatest commercial starring NBA players ever made? Im not sure I can make that argument, not in a world where Michael Jordan is free to peddle bacon-resistant undershirts while showing off the prized Hitler mustache he won in a high-stakes canasta game with an ailing Marge Schott in late 2003. But its certainly the greatest commercial for a once-regionally ubiquitous discount electronics retailer featuring the starting lineup of the 1994 New York Knicks playing poker with Sunday-newspaper circular coupons. With a production budget upwards of fifteen Valpaks brimming with New Rochelle-area manicurist deals, (Nobody Beats) The Wiz lured Patrick Ewing, John Starks, Charles Oakley, Anthony Mason, and Derek Harper into its promotional Thunderdome and let the teammates unleash their cutthroat competitive instincts upon one another. Though only a portion of a single hand is shown, with Mason re-raising Ewings bet with $200 in Wiz Bucks (look closely and you can see the loose-aggressive Starks mouth, \"Fuck em up, Mase!\" to the bluffing forward), a slow-playing Oakley would soon clean everyone out with trip Kings, then later flip his massive savings into \n. Mason, it should be noted, was given free sealer-wax upgrades for life. \n\n\nBecause there isnt one person on Planet Earth who doesnt love Gheorge Muresan.\n\n\nThis is not intended to be some sort of corporate self-promotion. I honestly couldnt think of or find another commercial with an NBA player in it that I enjoyed more than this. It was these random slice-of-life moments that made the \"This is \n\" campaign so distinctively memorable. The matter-of-fact \"Were just dancing\" kills me every time. And if you pay close attention, youll see that Muresan is actually the best dancer of the bunch. Its hard to imagine that this commercial was made almost 16 years ago. \n\n\nI watch this video once a week, just to remind myself that for 1.8 seconds, Tim Duncan was the coolest dude in NBA history. Ive stood in front of the mirror and tried to perfect the \"Im the Tim\" part, but I always slip up between .9 and 1.3 seconds. Theres no replicating what he did in the beginning of this Sprite commercial. Kobe, I know you had an \n rap career and all, but please know that for 1.8 seconds, you got GOT by The Tim. \n\n\nRight off the bat, YouTube failed me. I searched for the black-and-white John Starks ad where the former Knicks guard is filmed through a chain-link fence, hooping at a playground to the song \"\n.\" The lines \"Thats my hook shot with my eyebrow\" and \"Ill go one-on-one against the world\" never sounded so right. Alas, its not there. \nSo I looked for no. 2 on my list: \"Hey Karl, sign my Rogaine?\" Failed again. Damn Utah and its revisionist historians. \nBut my third-favorite NBA commercial is still worthy of the Hall: A commercial for Shawn Kemps \"Kamikaze\" Reeboks in the mid-nineties that blatantly rips off \n. Kemp is beamed into a spike-filled netherland where a six-armed samurai Goro challenges him to a game. At first, Kemp gets his one-hander swatted. Things look grim until a horrific pair of zebra-patterned Reeboks appear on the ground. Kemp hops into the sneakers and proceeds to give Goro the \n treatment, or, as Shaq calls it, the \"Lister Blister.\" The dunk weakens the boss, and Kemp lets out a primal scream that disintegrates the alien big man. You can almost hear a voice growl, \"Finish Him.\" Yes, this commercial is bad enough to make the film \n look good. But it takes chutzpah to fail sensationally, and I respect that.  \n\n\nHey guys, so Tyler Hansbrough is this great college basketball player and hes a bit scary and Im not sure he can speak in complete sentences without spitting, so what we should do is put him in this commercial with a sped-up hacked version of a Velvet Underground song in the background. Yes, I understand the song is about drugs, but were selling a 3G network to people who listen to Matchbox 20. They wont get the reference. Anyway, so well have this cute kid lose her dog and then well have Tyler Hansbrough find it and then sit in front of a house and smile at the camera and cut the tape before he rips off the dogs head and drinks its blood in front of the horrified child. \n\n\n The Scotch and Sirloin sounds like the restaurant that would open in a \n theme park. Actually, it was a hot spot for those looking to meet up pre- and post-Celtics/Bruins games during the 70s and 80s (the restaurant closed in 1991). Apparently, it was also the official eatery of one of the greatest collection of basketball players in NBA history: the 1986 Boston Celtics. This ad is a whos who of Hall of Famers: Kevin McHale, Dennis Johnson, Bill Walton, Robert Parish, and, of course, Larry Bird. However, when it comes to the dialogue, its as D-league as you would expect from a collection of elite athletes. From Rick Carlisle arguing, \"No, man, its the prime rib!\" to Robert Parish fulfilling his annual speech quota by simply saying \"Lobster,\" the only saving grace is that Larry Legend has chosen to exercise his \"strong, silent type\" personality. Until  uh-oh, no. 33 is clinking his glass  and hes wearing a Laker-purple shirt. OK, Larry, go ahead: \"Well, boys, after a meal like this theres only one way to show our appreciation.\" And he starts the wave. At a dinner table. How the hell were there groupies back then?\n\n\nThere exists in this world a shoe commercial where Kevin McHale raps. This is that commercial.\n\n\nOne word, three syllables, Grandmama.The HGH multivitamin of NBA commercials. \n, though Im partial to this clip, with footage from his appearance on \n, and a comment from one of the extras who remembers the occasion fondly. But until this assignment I didnt realize Tyler Perry and Larry Johnson/Grandmama are the same age, and possibly the same person. Have you ever seen them in the same place? And LJ is easily a DNA match for Tyler Perrys typical male archetype (and Grandmama archetype). The NBA is so awesome, everyone who hates Tyler Perry and his plays/movies/TV shows would absolutely be converted on the spot if we could confirm the truth that they were all written by Larry Johnson.\n\n \nIn which two retired pivot men walk into a bar and make podiatric jokes, thereby reinforcing that 1986 was really just one long and not particularly funny \nepisode.\n\n\nI am not ashamed to admit that I have this song on my iPod. It is the perfect blend of hip-hop and basketball: Allen Iverson shilling his shoes while dribbling a basketball to Jadakiss raspy lyrics. The beat is set to screeching shoes, a dribbling basketball, and the ball swishing through the net. Jadakisss lyrics are mostly on point and you hardly notice when he slips into the overt marketing: \"All you need is a pair of these and nothing else. Your hesitation to stop and pop will be something else.\" It is kind of weird that Jadakiss wears a Jets jersey and not a Knicks one and it is good that Iverson wisely does not try to rap in the video. I do not know how the shoes perform, but the commercial is nicely done.  \n\n\nYou know the infinitesimal span of time that it takes your synapse to snap between you thinking of moving your hand to open the door and you actually moving your hand to open the door? Thats basically what were talking about between me reading \"YouTube HOF: NBA Player Commercials\" in an e-mail subject line and thinking \"Antoine Walker, Employee #8.\" Im pretty sure thats the case for anyone of a certain age that grew up in the greater Boston area. I swear, for years Id check YouTube every few months to see if any kindly soul had updated this. (Dont worry, I didnt wait for YouTubes reach to expand that far; I eventually tracked it down in some weirder, darker corner of the Internet). For the casual observer, this was of ironic note long before Walker went broke. Thats because Antoine never came close to becoming a superstar worthy of his own commercial, which gave the faux-humbleness on display here a strange, layered allure, and saddled the real-life usage of the \"Employee #8\" nickname with an implicit malice. But for the fans, for years -- during those dark, dark, Pervis Ellisonian, Vitaly Potapenk-esque late-90s -- Toines national commercial was our only proof that anyone else in the country knew we existed. Even later down the line, when we had actual stars, they never got cool commercials (the only thing I remember Pierce in is an ad for that \n). \"Thats me. Employee no. 8. I make baskets\"?! Awesome.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this story through Facebook, \n. Read more \n."}]}
